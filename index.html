	<h1>Welcome to Bible Cave</h1>
	<p>Over the millennia gradually but surely, beginning in the first few centuries after the death of Christ, truth has been lost sight of, buried under endless rituals and tradition as taught by the church fathers, just as if they had been buried in a cave, and the entrance closed tight. It is our purpose to break through this closed entrance and explore this cave with you and to uncover these truths for one and all, that everyone may have a true understanding of what the Bible really teaches, in it's beauty and simplicity.</p>
    
	<h2>Important Theological Questions</h2>
	<p>If you have had a reasonable amount of prayerful study in God's Word, the Holy Bible, you would no doubt have had questions come up in your mind as to what the Bible teaches and what your church teaches, with them sometimes being considerably different! This is healthy, because God was leading you to make these discoveries. Unfortunately most people turn to their 'spiritual leaders' for guidance. In many cases this is a huge mistake, as most leaders inevitably lead you into a false sense of security by helping you reject plain teachings in God's Word.</p>
    <p>What did Jesus say about the church, or spiritual, leaders when He was here? In Matthew 15:13, 14 Jesus is talking about the Pharisees, and in the verses just before this His disciples came and told Him the Pharisees were offended by what He was saying, "But he (Jesus) answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch."</p>
	<p>Therefore, we would encourage you to prayerfully study the Bible for yourselves, and let God's Holy Spirit guide you into all truth, and not rely on your local church priest, pastor, reverend, vicar, minister, chaplain, cleric, parson, preacher, rector, pontiff, guru or astrologist for your understanding the scriptures!</p>
    <p>The Bible says, "Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." 2 Timothy 2:15</p>
    <p>Also in Acts 17:11 we have these words, "These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so."</p>
    <p>In other words, do not believe what we tell you just on face value. Same goes for what anyone else tells you, and it does not matter how many degrees they have or how many impressive letters come after their name! They are also human beings like all of us, and as such, they do not have the power of infallibility; they can come to a wrong understanding of Bible teaching too. Study it for yourself and verify it is correct from God's Word. That is the only measurement for truth we can rely on. Nothing else is as important.</p>

	<h2>Topics and History</h2>
	<p>The two most important menu items on this website are Topics and History. Topics will get past the entrance of this cave and uncover the lost truths which most people in most churches are not even aware of or know exist!</p>    
    <img src="images/open_bible_prayer.jpg" style='width:100%;' alt="Null">
    <p>History will outline what has happened during the time since Jesus was upon the earth, and how the church has strayed so far from the Christian gospel message of Jesus Christ.</p>

    <h2>Side Issues</h2>
    <p>As we near the end of this world's history, winds of doctrine are blowing on all sides. Even God's people are getting swept away by these things. This area of the website is devoted to clearing the cobwebs and exposing these theories.</p>

    <h2>About and Contact</h2>
    <p>About and Contact are pretty straightforward. About is about us!</p>
    <img src="images/contact_home.jpg" style='width:100%;' alt="Null">    
    <p>Contact is how you can contact us if you have a question or concern about a topic or would like to get in touch with us. All correspondence is welcome, so don't be shy!</p>
