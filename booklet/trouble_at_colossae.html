<h1>Trouble At Colossae</h1>
<h3>by Jack Capman</h3>
	
<br/>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The purpose of this booklet is to assist with modern day understanding of a seemingly difficult passage (Colossians 2:14-16), by focusing on the situation at the time of Paul’s letter. A review of the whole book will aid in understanding Paul’s concern for the problems that existed in the church at Colossae, as well as in other fledgling churches. This was why Paul requested that this letter be read to the church at Laodicea. (Colossians 4:16)</p>
	<p>Remember that the early Christian churches consisted of Jewish, Gentile, and pagan converts who mentally brought their previous cultures, beliefs, and practices with them. All their beliefs had to be harmonized, without compromise, to the will of God. Some of these beliefs were deeply ingrained and difficult to give up. Modern day converts understand from experience how pride rears its ugly head when truth shines its light on an error. Relinquishing long held beliefs, though painful, was necessary to gain the humility that Paul wrote about in Philippians 2:5-6.</p>
	<p>Additionally, the letter which Paul wrote had no chapters or verses. Therefore, its message is continuous. In other words, the entire book of Colossians constitutes a single letter to the church at Colossae, from Paul, who was at that time imprisoned in Rome, most probably in AD 57. (Acts 28:16, 30)</p>
	<p>Note that Paul, the writer of this letter, was a scholar educated by the highly respected teacher, Gamaliel, and had a deep background in Jewish theology. This experience included the various civil laws and regulations that God gave the Israelites to better govern themselves as a nation. The only “scriptures” available to Paul were the Old Testament writings since the New Testament had not been compiled yet. Being a scholar, he knew that some of their laws were not from God. These man-made laws and traditions were an attempt at self sanctification—legalism.</p>
	<p>Lastly, when reading any printed word, there is no vocal inflection to give emphasis, and knowledge of the idioms of the day is very limited. When studying the Bible, reliance on the context of the passage, scripture comparison, and a good concordance are all important to proper understanding. These are the methods and tools employed, along with prayer, as we examine, verse by verse, the Epistle to the Colossians.</p>
	<p>The author of this booklet has utilized underlining and bolding for emphasis, and Scriptures are italicized!</p>
<h2>Colossians One</h2>
<h3>Colossians 1:1-6</h3>
	<p>Paul identified himself as the author of the letter. <strong>Note:</strong> The city of Colossae, was not listed as a destination in any of Paul’s missionary trips. It is believed that he never visited the church but apparently was acquainted with a few of its members who made him aware of some of the internal contentions. Timothy may well have been the scribe of this epistle writing and distributing Paul’s words.</p>
	<p>He gave thanks for the church, and said that he was always in prayer for the members since he had heard of their faith in Jesus and their love for the saints.</p>
<h3>Colossians 1:7-11</h3>
	<p>Epaphras was apparently the evangelist responsible for the raising up of the Colossian church and a Colossian citizen himself. (Colossians 4:12)</p>
	<p>Paul told the members that the deepest desire of his heart was for their spiritual maturation. In these verses he points to the importance of gaining knowledge of God and His will. He exhorted them to walk worthy of the Lord while cultivating patience and longsuffering with joy—all of which was possible when they received God’s enabling power.</p>
<h3>Colossians 1:12-14</h3>
	<p>The apostle gave thanks to the Father who purposed to deliver His people from the “power of darkness” and make everyone able to partake of salvation.</p>
<h3>Colossians 1:15-23</h3>
	<p>Here Paul lifted up Jesus as “the image of the invisible GOD”, the Creator of every creature, and the Firstborn of man! The term Firstborn represents the position of preeminence.</p>
	<p>Christ, Paul declared, was to be the head of the church. Further, he said that Christ’s sacrifice reconciled all things to Himself, including those who had been enemies with the provision that they would continue in the faith. Paul also mentioned the gospel’s widespread proclamation to the entire world.</p>
<h3>Colossians 1:24-27</h3>
	<p>As a minister appointed by God, Paul said that his mission was to make plain the “mystery” hidden from people for ages, that God is a God for all people. <strong>Note:</strong> This was hidden because the Israelites did not reveal it to the heathen as they were instructed to do. Having explained that Jesus was the “<em>image of the invisible God</em>,” he showed the “mystery” as being “<em>Christ in you, the hope of glory</em>.”</p>
<h3>Colossians 1:28, 29</h3>
	<p>This labor of love was to warn, to preach, and to teach, and was in order to <em>“present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.”</em> This was Paul’s mission through the power of God!</p>
<h2>Colossians 2</h2>
<h3>Colossians 2:1-3</h3>
	<p>Paul noted that he was greatly troubled by the problems he had become aware of in the Colossian and Laodicean churches. Then he outlined his goal as that of “knitting their hearts together,” and preempting false doctrine by making sure they understood this “mystery.”</p>
<h3>Colossians 2:4</h3>
	<p>Four warnings are offered by Paul in this chapter. Here they are listed together.</p>
	<p>1. He said, <em>“let no man <strong>beguile</strong> you, with enticing words”</em> (Greek: paralogizomai meaning: Let no man trick you with false logic.)</p>
	<p>2. In Colossians 2:8 the warning is: <em>“Beware lest any man <strong>spoil</strong> you through philosophy and vain deceit…”</em> (Greek: solagogeo meaning: to lead away as booty, seduce.)</p>
	<p>3. In Colossians 2:16, Paul said, <em>“Let no man <strong>judge</strong> you…”</em> (Greek: krino meaning: to call into question, or condemn.)</p>
	<p>4. Paul added this in Colossians 2:18, <em>“Let no man <strong>beguile</strong> you…”</em> (Gr. Katabrabeou meaning: to defraud you of salvation or of your reward.)</p>
<h3>Colossians 2:5-10</h3>
	<p>When Paul made this <em>“absent in the flesh...with you in spirit”</em> statement, he was a prisoner in Rome. He wanted the members to know that he was of the same spiritual mind as they were. He<strong> spiritually saw</strong> their <em>“steadfastness in faith.”</em></p>
	<p>His exhortations to the members were for them to continue life in Jesus, thus avoiding falling prey to man’s philosophy and vain (empty) deceits. He added that those who are careful not to listen to these things would enjoy the “fullness” of the Godhead and be complete in Christ, the <em>“head of all principality and power.”</em></p>
<h3>Colossians 2:11-13</h3>
	<p>Here, Paul pointed out to the members that through their acceptance of Christ, and subsequent baptism, they were forgiven. In Romans, Paul emphasized that the circumcision necessary for the new members, was circumcision of the heart instead of physical circumcision.</p>
	<p><em>“For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.”</em> (Romans 2:28, 29)</p>
	<p>Circumcision is one of the problems Paul also dealt with in his letter to the church in Galatia. (Galatians 5:6)</p>
	<p>Where did circumcision originate? God gave it to Abraham years before the Egyptian captivity (Genesis 17:2-14). It was to be a sign denoting the people’s acceptance of the covenant between them and God. After their release from slavery, the Israelites were instructed by God to begin this sacrifice again. (Leviticus 12:2-3, John 7:22-23) We will address circumcision later in this booklet.</p>
	<p>At this point it is necessary for us to look at the distinction between God’s <strong><u>moral laws</u></strong> and His <strong><u>sacrificial laws</u></strong>. <strong>The moral laws, the Ten Commandments</strong>, were first given orally by God to Moses on Mt. Sinai, and then God wrote them in stone with His own finger! (Exodus chapters 19, 20) They were given to all men as <strong>a transcript of His eternal character. They identified sin and became a guide for everyone throughout time.</strong></p>
	<p><em>“At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood. And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand. And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me. And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.”</em> (Deuteronomy 10:1-5)</p>
	<p>Moses threw down and broke the two tables in his anger at the Israelites. Then God instructed Moses to hew out two more tables. God rewrote the same moral laws using His own finger. Moses then put them <strong>inside</strong> the ark as God had instructed.</p>
	<p>God also told Moses to write <strong>other</strong> instructions. These were the sacrificial laws which all pointed to Jesus’ death and resurrection which was to be the event that provided redemption for all mankind who accepted it by faith. These were the <strong>remedy</strong> for sin and were in the form of “statutes, judgments, and ordinances.” Those can be found throughout some of the early books of the Bible. (Some examples are: Leviticus 18:4-5, Exodus 18:20, Deuteronomy 10:13)</p>
	<p>When God finished giving Moses those statutes, He told Moses to make them into a song and teach it to the children of Israel <em>“that it might be a witness for me <strong>against the children of Israel.</strong>”</em> (Deuteronomy 31:19-22)</p>
	<p><em>“Take this book of the law, and put it <strong>in the side of the ark</strong> of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there <strong>for a witness against thee</strong>.”</em> (Deuteronomy 31:26)</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> At the time of this writing by Paul, Israel, as a nation, had broken the covenant, and had already lost the designation “People of God.” Jesus told them that their “house” was now <strong>desolate/empty</strong>. (Matthew 23:38)</p>
<h2>Blotting Out the “Handwriting of Ordinances”</h2>
<h3>Colossians 2:14</h3>
	<p>This is the beginning of a very interesting but misunderstood passage for many Christians. It is the very heart of this study. Here is the first part of the verse, “<em>Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us…</em>”    <strong><em> </em></strong>This phrase raises several questions. (Remember that chapters, verses, and punctuation were added by translators, and/or editors). Sometimes it is helpful to read around a verse for context, especially if it seems hard to understand. View this verse in the light of Colossians 2:12-13. This “blotting out” of “the handwriting of ordinances” was accomplished at the cross by Christ’s voluntary sacrifice. What were the ordinances that the verse refers to as being <strong>“against us”</strong>? The answer to that question is found in Deuteronomy 31:26-28.</p>
	<p><em>“Take this book of the law, and put it <strong>in the side of the ark</strong> of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there <strong>for a witness against thee</strong>. For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death? Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.”</em></p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong>The Ten Commandments, the moral law of God, were placed <strong>inside</strong> the ark of the covenant, while the God-directed law of ordinances (written by Moses’ hand) was placed <strong>in the side</strong> of the ark!</p>
	<p>What did Paul declare was in the ark of the covenant?</p>
	<p><em>“Then verily the first covenant had also <strong>ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary</strong>. For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary. And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, <strong>wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant</strong>;”</em> (Hebrews 9:1-4)</p>
	<p>The covenant that God made with the nation of Israel can be found, in substance, in Deuteronomy, chapters 29 and 30. However, He wanted (and wants) all of mankind to live by <em>“every word which proceeded out of the mouth of God”</em>. (Deuteronomy 8:3) This was quoted by Jesus to Satan in Matthew 4:4 and Luke 4:4.</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here’s what Paul said in Hebrews:</p>
	<p><em>“For the law</em> [Mosaic handwritten law] <em>having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect. For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but <strong>a body hast thou prepared me</strong>: In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.</em></p>
	<p><em>Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.<strong> Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;</strong></em> (obviously, this refers to the sacrificial laws) <em><strong>Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</strong>”</em> (Hebrews 10:1-9)</p>
	<p><strong>Note: Faith in the coming Redeemer’s blood</strong>, symbolized by the blood of the animal sacrifices, was the saving factor. So, the salvation by faith promised in the Old Testament was accomplished by the same faith as that in the New Testament! The first, looking forward by faith to Christ’s sacrifice, and the latter looking back on the same event, both are accomplished by faith.</p>
	<p>There are three passages below from three different Bible books which are helpful as we consider this subject.</p>
	<p>1. <strong>Faith</strong> manifest by action. <em>“By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.”</em> (Hebrews 11:4 - Please read the entire chapter.)</p>
	<p>2. <strong>Belief</strong> proved by action. <em>“And he</em> [Abram] <em><strong>believed</strong> in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.”</em> (Genesis 15:6)</p>
	<p>3. <strong>Action</strong> justifying the <strong>faith/belief</strong> by which Christ’s righteousness is obtained by all those who believed and acted by faith in accordance with Christ’s commandments.</p>
	<p><em><strong>“Jesus abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of <u>commandments contained in ordinances</u>…”</strong></em> (Ephesians 2:15)</p>
	<p>Remember that it was Jesus who was crucified—not the law(s). The Perfect Provision had been made for the enmity caused by sin.</p>
	<p>The last part of Colossians 2:14 says, “(…these ordinances) <em>which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to <strong>His</strong> cross.”</em></p>
	<p>Question: Who took these ordinances “out of the way, nailing it to His cross”? Was it the Roman soldiers? Hardly! They were only interested in getting the crucifixion over with.</p>
	<p>Was it the Jews? No! But they were the major participants in His trial and crucifixion. Jesus said from the cross, <em>“Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”</em> (Luke 23:34)</p>
	<p>Is it reasonable to think that either the Jews or Romans put the crucifixion on hold, while someone ran into Jerusalem to get copies of any of these laws or ordinances from the Temple, in order to nail them to the cross?</p>
	<p>With the above in mind, and before we answer the question of who specifically, consider what the Bible says was put on the cross, in addition to Jesus. <em>“And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS”.</em> (John 19:19) Pilate made no mention of the Ten Commandments or the ordinances in his writing.</p>
	<p>In the phrase, “<em>took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross,” </em>the Greek word translated “it” is <em>autos</em>, which can be, and many believe should be translated “them”! Then the phrase would read, <em>“took <strong>them</strong> (the ordinances and their condemnation) out of the way, nailing <strong>them</strong> to His cross.”</em> Jesus, was the “who” that <strong>voluntarily took the sacrificial system <em>“out of the way”</em> by His death!</strong> Jesus was the body referred to in Hebrews 10:5.</p>
	<p><em>“Wherefore when He cometh into the world, He saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:”</em></p>
	<p>Jesus was the embodiment of the sacrificial laws. (1 Corinthians 5:7, 8) He was the law! If this is a problem to our thinking, consider John 1:1-14, which states that <em>“The Word</em> [the Creator, Jesus] <em>became Flesh, and dwelt among us”</em>. (verse 14) His death ratified the justice of that law and at the same time demonstrated God’s mercy by taking on Himself the penalty for our sins! Please note this: if the law which declared, <em>“The soul that sinneth shall surely die.”</em> (Ezekiel 18:20) could have been changed, Jesus would not have had to die!</p>
	<p>Consideration must be given to the role of these two laws, the <strong>moral</strong> and the <strong>ceremonial</strong>. When a man sinned, he broke the moral law—the Ten Commandments. Then he brought his offering according to the ceremonial law, and he received forgiveness. The moral law defines sin because sin is the transgression of the moral law. (1 John 3:4) The ceremonial law foreshadowed the remedy for sin with its sacrifices and services. When the Israelite sinned, he broke the moral law. To secure forgiveness he had to obey the ceremonial law. God gave them two very different laws with two distinct purposes.</p>
	<p>When Jesus died as the perfect sacrifice for all mankind, the shadowy ceremonial system was no longer needed. It was nailed to the cross. It is said that this is an allusion to an ancient practice. A bond or obligation was first written down and then cancelled, by driving a nail through it, and affixing it to a post.</p>
	<p>The moral law remains, but it is no longer external to us as when it was engraved in cold stone. The new covenant is based on “better promises” (Hebrews 8:6). <em>“This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, <strong>I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them</strong>.”</em> (Hebrews 10:16) The moral law is now written on every <strong>renewed</strong> heart.</p>
	<p>Notice this comment from the pen of E. G. White:</p>
	<p>“Paul desired his brethren to see that the great glory of a sin pardoning savior gave significance to the entire Jewish economy.</p>
	<p>He desired them to see also that when Christ came into the world, and died as man’s sacrifice, type met anti-type. <strong>After Christ died on the cross as a sin offering, the ceremonial law could have no force. Yet it was connected to the moral law, and was glorious. The whole bore the stamp of divinity, and expressed the holiness, justice and righteousness of God.</strong> And if the ministration of the dispensation to be done away with was glorious, how much more must the reality be glorious, when Christ was revealed, giving his life-giving, sanctifying, Spirit to all who believe?” (SDA Bible Commentary, Volume 6, page 1095)</p>
<h3>Colossians 2:15</h3>
	<p>The theme of this verse is a continuation of the changes Jesus made in the lives of His children, by His sacrifice.</p>
	<p><em>“And having spoiled principalities and powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.”</em> (Colossians 2:15)</p>
<h2>What are the principalities and powers?</h2>
	<p><em>Funk &amp; Wagnells Dictionary</em> offers two definitions for the word “principality”:</p>
	<p>1. “The territory of a reigning prince.”</p>
	<p>2. “Powers or powerful influences, as celestial or demonic powers.”</p>
	<p>Did not Jesus spoil the power of the “Prince of this world”–Satan–who <strong>is</strong> the demonical power? Was it not done openly (Greek: enperihelia = with boldness)? By His death and subsequent resurrection, did He not also triumph over the “powers” of Caiaphas and the Jewish legal body? Did He or did He not “make a show of them openly”?</p>
<h3>Colossians 2:16</h3>
	<p>If Jesus’ death made the laws of none effect which were contained in those ordinances, <em><strong>"which were against us” “and contrary to us,"</strong></em> why then, would anyone allow themselves to be judged by someone else for not continuing in their observance?</p>
	<p>Who is our ultimate Judge? Who did Paul single out as the judge of all mankind? He answered both questions in his letter to Timothy.</p>
	<p><em>“Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which <strong>the Lord, the righteous judge</strong>, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.”</em> (2 Timothy 4:8)</p>
	<p>The words “righteous judge” in the Greek are <em>“dikaios krites”</em> which mean exactly that. It is only God who can and will pronounce His people righteous, and sentence the unrighteous to their final punishment!</p>
	<p>In the Beatitudes, Jesus cautioned all people when He said, <em>“Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.”</em> (Matthew 7:1-2)</p>
	<p>The apostle John wrote this:</p>
	<p><em>“Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.”</em> (John 7:24)</p>
	<p>In both of the above texts, the word “judge” means to call into question and condemn. This does not refer to evaluation! It is imperative that we be able to maintain and exercise our God given ability to weigh evidence with the Holy Spirit’s assistance in order to discern or judge and then choose between the good and bad! The evidence may then be presented in a loving way, allowing the Holy Spirit to do the work of conviction on the hearts of others.</p>
	<p>So then, what is Paul talking so negatively about in verse 16?</p>
	<p><em>“…Matters of meat, or in drink or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days, which are a shadow of things to come; but the body</em> [that cast the shadow] <em>is of Christ.”</em></p>
	<p>In the original, it could read: <em>“… and the body is of Christ.”</em> That would make all those ordinances point forward to the death of Christ.</p>
	<p>Throughout the next several pages, evidence is presented from Leviticus, chapter 23, showing that these ordinances are the laws referred to in this New Testament passage.</p>
	<p><em>“Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.”</em> (Leviticus 23:2)</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong>The word translated “convocations” in the KJV is from the Hebrew word <em>Miqra,</em> which means “assemblies”.</p>
	<p>After that are listed the various ordinances described as feasts. Incidentally, the Hebrew word for feasts is <em>Mo’ed</em>. It can also be translated as: assembly, congregation, season, appointed time, solemn, solemnity, or days (see <em>Strong’s Concordance</em>). They were solemn occasions that demonstrated the cost of salvation and were to awaken a spirit of deep, heartfelt gratitude to God for His mercy and grace!</p>
	<p>The first law mentioned in Leviticus 23:3 is the <strong>regular, weekly, seventh day Sabbath established in Eden</strong>. This was a reminder to the Israelites of the Fourth Commandment originally given to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (hundreds of years before a Jew existed) and repeated to the Jews on Mt. Sinai.</p>
	<p>Biblical evidence found in Exodus 16:10-30 proves conclusively that the Israelites had knowledge of <strong>the Sabbath</strong> prior to the giving of the Ten Commandments from Mt Sinai. (Exodus 20:8-11) There is no question that God wanted the people to remember it from past experience as well as in the future.</p>
	<p>The first three verses in this passage speak about this Special Sabbath day! The weekly Sabbath is further separated at the end of the very same chapter. (see verses 37, 38) We will examine those verses later.</p>
<h2>Feast Days</h2>
	<p>Here is a list of the different feasts:</p>
	<p>Feast of the Passover: Leviticus 23:4-5</p>
	<p>Feast of Unleavened Bread: Leviticus 23:6-8</p>
	<p>Feast of First Fruits verses: Leviticus 23:10-14</p>
	<p>Feast of Harvest: Leviticus 23:15-22 (Pentecost in N.T.)</p>
	<p>Feast of Trumpets: Leviticus 23:23-25</p>
	<p>Day of Atonement: Leviticus 23:26-32</p>
	<p>Feast of Tabernacles: Leviticus 23:33-36</p>
	<p>Now it is time to “unpack” Colossians 2:16 and find the matching references in the Leviticus account. Remember that Paul addressed a variety of converts, some of which were Gentile converts and some were formerly pagans. The Jews wanted to continue with the feasts which they were accustomed to celebrating, and they were constantly trying to coerce the others into participating in the feasts.</p>
<h3><em>" ...in matters of meat and drink ..."</em></h3>
	<p>    What Paul said to the new Christian was to not let any man judge them “in matters of meat, or in drink.” The Greek word for meat is <em>brosis</em>. The same word is used for food, or meal. (In the O.T. the corresponding word is <em>lechem</em>.)</p>
	<p>In Leviticus 23:6, the Israelites were told to eat “unleavened bread.” In verse 37 of the same chapter, we see that there were not only “meat” offerings, but “drink offerings,” as well.</p>
<h3><em>"... in matters of an holyday ..."</em></h3>
	<p>Paul next said that no man should judge in matters of “an holyday.” Those “holy days” obviously referred to the <strong>annual</strong> feast days. Previously we noted that those gatherings were called “convocations or assemblies.” In Leviticus, chapter 23, verses 7, 8, 21, 24, 27, 35 and 37, the days are called “Holy convocations.”</p>
<h3><em>"... new moon ..."</em></h3>
	<p>Today the calendar is the best place to look to find out when the new moon is to appear. Of course, the Israelites had no such calendar. <strong>Note:</strong> In all eleven Old Testament references, “new moons” was translated from the Hebrew word, <em>chodesh</em> which means, month, new moon, monthly, or another. It spoke about the monthly appearance of the new moon.</p>
	<p>Jewish months all began with the appearance of the crescent new moon, also called first “visible sliver.” Even today, the Hebrew word for month literally means New Moon (and by extension, the period between one New Moon and the next).</p>
	<p>David said that God created the moon and then used it to mark the beginning times for the feast days.</p>
	<p><em>“He appointed the moon for seasons</em> [Mo‘adim /Mow-ed = feast days].” (Psalms 104:19)</p>
	<p>Nowhere in Moses’ instructions, regarding the Sacrificial Laws or Ordinances, did he include “new moons” as a feast day. However, God gave Moses instructions for sacrifices and offerings to be made daily in Numbers 28:1-8. Verses 9-10 are the requirements for the Sabbath day offerings. Then, for the first day of each month (designated by the new moon), God gave Moses instructions as to what offerings were to be made on that day.</p>
	<p><em>“And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot; And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram; And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD. And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb: <strong>this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year</strong>. And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.”</em> (Numbers 28:11-15)</p>
	<p><strong>Note: </strong>Measurements used in the instructions were: Deal: about a gallon (Leviticus 23:17)</p>
	<p>Hin: one gallon or 22.91L</p>
	<p>Ephah (same as Omer): 20.8 quarts or 2.3L</p>
	<p>Following those commandments are the other feast day offerings. Compare this with the sacrificial laws of Leviticus 23.</p>
	<p>As time went on, the children of Israel got involved in the worship of the moon with their pagan friends despite God’s specific warning against doing so! They began to worship the creation instead of the Creator. Incredible!</p>
	<p><em>“Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire: Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female, The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth: <strong>And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them,</strong> which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.”</em> (Deuteronomy 4:15-19)</p>
	<p><em>“And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, <strong>to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven</strong>.”</em> (2 Kings 23:5)</p>
	<p>Ezekiel was given a vision in the twenty-fifth year of the Babylonian captivity (Ezekiel chapter 40). In this vision, he was told how to re-build the Sanctuary that had been destroyed by the Babylonian army. He was also given detailed instructions as to how to re-instate the sacrificial system. Here are the sacrifices that were to be made on “the day of the new moon.”</p>
	<p><em>“Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD <strong>in the sabbaths and in the <u>new moons</u></strong></em> [first days of the months]. <em>And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. <strong>And in the day of the new moon</strong> it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish. And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.”</em> (Ezekiel 46:3-7)</p>
<h3>Other New Moon References</h3>
	<p>The first Bible reference to “new moons” in conjunction with the feast days, is in 1 Chronicles 23:31.</p>
	<p><em>“And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, <strong>according to the order commanded unto them</strong>, continually before the LORD…”</em></p>
	<p><em>“Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, <strong>in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day</strong>. For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob. This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.”</em> (Psalm 81:3-5)</p>
	<p>In other words, “Announce the beginning of each appointed feast day, in the appropriate month, by the blowing of the horn.”</p>
	<p>If you read the rest of this Psalm, it seems to talk about Israel’s release from Egyptian captivity, and in all probability means that when the feasts were held annually (at the time appointed, in the new moon/each year), the trumpet was to be sounded.</p>
	<p>In 2 Chronicles, chapters 29 and 30, King Hezekiah repaired the sanctuary and re-instated the Passover. It would be helpful to completely read these chapters before proceeding. Then in 2 Chronicles 31:3 the writer used the phrase, “written in the law of the Lord.”</p>
	<p><em>“Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities. And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD. He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, <strong>as it is written in the law of the LORD</strong>.”</em></p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> In <em>Young’s Literal Translation</em>, the last of the verse reads like this: “of new moons, and appointed seasons as it is….”</p>
	<p>Hezekiah assigned the priests their courses (different duties), and he appointed a portion of the king’s substance to use as burnt offerings, and for the set feasts, <em>as it is written in the law of God</em>. Obviously, this “law” referred to is the sacrificial law.</p>
	<p>In Ezra 3:5, Ezra declared: <em>“And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.”</em></p>
	<p>Ezra was responsible for helping to re-build Jerusalem after the 70 years of Babylonian captivity. It is recorded that they <em>“builded the altar of God to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses.”</em> (Ezra 3:2)</p>
	<p>Some time later Nehemiah also became involved in the rebuilding of the temple and the walls in Jerusalem. He and the prophet Ezekiel both report that they “made ordinances” for themselves.</p>
	<p><em>“Also <strong>we made ordinances for us,</strong> to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God; For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.”</em> (Nehemiah 10:32-33; Ezekiel 45:16-17)</p>
	<p>Clearly, God used “new moons” to establish times for these sacrifices. Without the appointed sacrifices and other requirements, there would not be any special significance for this day, or of any of the feast days that are outlined next.</p>
	<p>Here are references in which God told the people that He hated the way they eventually conducted these events.</p>
	<p><em>“Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.”</em> (Isaiah. 1:13-14; Hosea 2:9-13)</p>
	<p>Question: If the observance of new moons ceased with the death and resurrection of Christ, why will the redeemed be observing new moons in the earth made new?</p>
	<p><em>“For as the new heavens and the new earth, <strong>which I will make</strong>, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon</em> [month] <em>to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.”</em> (Isaiah 66:22-23)</p>
	<p>James White offered an excellent answer to this question!</p>
	<p>“The redeemed will have right to the tree of life, which Adam lost through disobedience. That tree yields twelve manner of fruits each month [Revelation 22:2]. And why may not the words of the prophet in reference to all flesh appearing before the Lord from one new moon to another, be fulfilled when the entire family of the redeemed shall come each month to,partake of the new fruit of the tree of life?” (White, <em>God’s Memorial,</em> page 8)</p>
	<p>Uriah Smith, J.N. Loughborough, and J.N. Andrews were all agreed that the <em>"new moons"</em> of Isaiah 66:23 will be the monthly visits of the saints to the tree of life in the earth made new. Perhaps this will serve as a memorial of the restoration of man to the tree of life and his physical reunion with Christ.</p>
<h3><em>"... of the sabbath days ..."</em></h3>
	<p>Leviticus 23 begins with these words:</p>
	<p><em>“And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts. Six days shall work be done: but the <strong>seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, an holy convocation;</strong> ye shall do no work therein: it is <strong>the Sabbath of the LORD</strong> in all your dwellings.”</em> (Leviticus 23:1-3)</p>
	<p>Then at the end of the instructions, this was the way that God reiterated that <strong>the Sabbath day</strong> was to be separate from the ceremonial sabbaths.</p>
	<p><em>“These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day: <strong><u>Beside</u> the Sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.” </strong></em> (Leviticus 23:37-38)</p>
	<p>This very special Sabbath Day has been given at creation to all mankind to meet with, fellowship with, and learn more about, their Creator and what He had created for them!</p>
	<p><em>“Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it:</em> [set it apart for holy use] <em>because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.”</em> (Genesis 2:2-3)</p>
	<p>The institution of the feast day, “shadow” sabbaths began hundreds of years later. <strong>Note:</strong> These sabbaths were <strong>annual</strong>, and though they sometimes fell on one of God’s special, weekly, Holy Sabbath days, more often they did not. Like a birthday, they could fall on any day of the week from year to year. Read the following instructions which God gave regarding when these feast days were to occur and how they were to be celebrated.</p>
<h2>Feast of the Passover</h2>
	<p><em>“In the <strong>fourteenth day of the first month</strong></em> [Nisan] <em>at even is the Lord’s passover.”</em> (Leviticus 23:4-5)</p>
	<p>Note that this feast commemorates the miraculous release of the Israelites from Egyptian captivity. The main feature of this is the sacrificial lamb, which was to be a first year lamb, without blemish. Read Exodus 12:3-14 for the complete instructions. In the New Testament, Jesus was referred to as “our Passover” in First Corinthians 5:7, and the writer of the gospel of John identifies Jesus with the Passover Lamb. (John 1:29; 36)</p>
	<p>As with all the feasts, the Passover had ordinances of “meat” offerings. These included the sacrificial lamb, unleavened bread, and bitter herbs. The blood was placed on the lintel of the door as a sign for the destroying angel to pass over the house, thus protecting the firstborn.</p>
	<p><em>“Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; <strong>every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb</strong>. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, <strong>wherein they shall eat it. And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.</strong>”</em> (Exodus 12:3-8)</p>
	<p>Also, notice in verse 3 that they were to bring the lamb to their house on the tenth day of the month, to be sacrificed on the fourteenth day. Why would it be important to have the lamb in the home four days prior to its death? Could it be that a stronger emotional attachment to the lamb might develop in order for the sacrifice to be more meaningful to the family?</p>
<h2>Feast of Unleavened Bread</h2>
	<p><em>“And on the <strong> fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread</strong> unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread. In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein. But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.”</em> (Leviticus 23:6-8)</p>
	<p><strong>Note: This feast is closely related to the Passover. It was to begin the next day</strong>, and the participants were to remember their experience just prior to leaving the Egyptian captivity when they had no time to prepare yeasted bread. The first and last days were ceremonial sabbaths, not the weekly, Holy Sabbath. First-born children were to be dedicated to the Lord’s service! (Remember the blood on the lintel saving the firstborn?) An additional requirement was that all males had to travel to Jerusalem, not only for this feast, but also the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Tabernacles. (Deuteronomy 16:16)</p>
	<p>Note: Leaven is Biblically recognized as symbolic of sin. Paul wrote to the Corinthians, <em>“Your glorying is not good, Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.”</em> (1 Corinthians 5:6-7)</p>
<h2>Feast of the Harvest: Wave Sheaf Ceremony, Day of First Fruits</h2>
	<p><em>“Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD. And the <strong>meat offering</strong> thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the <strong>drink offering</strong> thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin. And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.”</em> (Leviticus 23:10-14)</p>
	<p>“When the time for the cutting the sheaf had arrived…just as the sun went down, three men, each with a sickle and basket, formally set to work. But in order clearly to bring out all that was distinctive in the ceremony, they first asked the bystanders three times each of these questions: ‘Has the sun gone down?’ ‘With this sickle?’ ‘Into this basket?’ ‘On this Sabbath (or first Passover-day)?’ - and lastly, ‘Shall I reap?’ Having each time been answered in the affirmative, they cut down barley to the amount of one ephah, or ten omers, or three seahs, which is equal to about three pecks and three pints of our English measure. ... Though one ephah, or ten omers, of barley was cut down, only one omer of flour, ... was offered in the Temple.” (<em>The Temple - Its Ministry and Services</em>” by Alfred Edersheim, pages 204-205)</p>
	<p><strong>“Note</strong>: The word “wave” should be translated as “lift up or elevate”. The Tanakh (The Jewish Bible) translation translates verses 11-12 as: “He (the priest) shall <em>elevate</em> the sheaf before the Lord for acceptance in your behalf; the priest shall <em>elevate</em> it on the day after the Sabbath. (12) On the day that you <em>elevate</em> the sheaf, you shall offer as a burnt offering to the Lord a lamb of the first year without blemish.” (The Wave Sheaf Ceremony, info@icogsfg.org)</p>
	<p>This was a ceremony within the Feast of Unleavened Bread. It was held on the second day of the feast (the 16th day of Nisan). Like the Passover lamb, this sheaf of the first fruits also represented Christ. <em>“But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.”</em> (1 Corinthians 15:23)</p>
	<p>In addition to the wave sheaf offering, an unblemished lamb, unleavened bread, a “meat (meal) offering” (two tenth deals–an amount equal to two loaves)–of fine flour, and a “drink offering”–wine, (the fourth part of a hin, about one quart of unfermented grape juice) were also required with an additional restriction on eating from the harvest until the offerings were made. <strong>Note</strong>: these are the “meat” and “drink” offerings in Colossians 2:16.</p>
	<p>On the seventh and last day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Yom Tov), which was on the 21st day of the first month, there was to be a holy convocation and an offering. (Leviticus 23:8) No servile work was to be done. This was one of the yearly sabbaths.</p>
<h2>Feast of Weeks (also called Pentecost)</h2>
	<p><em>“And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete: Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD. Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD. And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their <strong>meat offering</strong>, and their <strong>drink offerings</strong>, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD... And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.”</em> (Leviticus 23:15-21)</p>
	<p>This holy day was celebrated on the sixth day of Sivan, fifty days after the waving of the first fruit. In the Greek, this day was called Pentecost. Like with the earlier feasts, this feast also required sacrifices of meat and drink offerings and another yearly sabbath.</p>
	<p>As a side note, they were to also leave grain at the edges of the fields and grapes at the edges of the vineyards for the poor to glean. This demonstrated the love of God and the provision of the “bread of life” for all, both rich and poor.</p>
	<p>Pentecost is mentioned only three times in the New Testament. First, we have the account in Acts 2 when the connection of Heaven with the new Christian Church was clearly established, which included the affirmation of their New Covenant status. (Acts 3:25) The other times mentioned are in Acts 20:16 and 1 Corinthians 16:8. Both refer to Paul’s intent to attend the feast, where a door was open for evangelism.</p>
	<p>The slaying of the paschal (Passover) lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month met its antitype in the death of Christ as the Lamb of God on that very day. (John 19; 1 Corinthians 5:7) The offering of the first-fruits on the sixteenth day of the first month met its antitype in the resurrection of our Lord on that very day. (1 Corinthians 15:20-23) Pentecost, fifty days later, was its antitype. (Acts 2:1, 2) Since these Spring feasts all met their antitypes in the beginning of the Church age, we should expect the Fall feasts (Trumpets, Day of Atonement and Tabernacles) to meet their antitype in the closing days of the Church age, shortly before the Second Coming.</p>
<h2>Feast of Trumpets</h2>
	<p><em>“Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the seventh month</em> [Tishri, or Tisri], <em>shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation. Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.”</em> (Leviticus 23:23-25)</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once again, here is mention of a yearly sabbath accompanied by an offering. This Ceremony is not mentioned in the New Testament. Most likely, the blowing of the trumpets was the annual reminder to the Israelites to prepare for the Day of Atonement, on the 10th day of the same month.</p>
	<p>According to E. G. White, the feast was celebrated during the time of Ezra and Nehemiah: “…This day was a festival, a day of rejoicing, a holy convocation, a day which the Lord had commanded the people to keep with joy and gladness; and in view of this they were bidden to restrain their grief and to rejoice because of God’s great mercy toward them. ‘This day is holy unto the Lord your God,’ Nehemiah said. ‘Mourn not, nor weep... Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the Lord is your strength.’ The earlier part of the day was devoted to religious exercises, and the people spent the remainder of the time in gratefully recounting the blessings of God and in enjoying the bounties that He had provided. Portions were also sent to the poor, who had nothing to prepare. There was great rejoicing because the words of the law had been read and understood.” (Prophets and Kings, page 662; also see Nehemiah 8:9, 10)</p>
<h2>Day of Atonement</h2>
	<p><em>“Also on the <strong>tenth day of this seventh month</strong> there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD. <strong>And ye shall do no work in that same day</strong>: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God. For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people. And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.”</em> (Leviticus 23:27-30)</p>
	<p>This was the most solemn day of the entire year. It was a day of deep heart-searching, for failure to afflict the soul and repent of sin would result in being cut off from Israel.</p>
	<p>In the type, the high priest would enter into the <strong>Holy of Holies</strong>, the second apartment of the sanctuary, to make an atonement for the sins of the people and to cleanse the sanctuary from all the accumulated sins of the year. These sins had been symbolically transferred, via the blood, into the sanctuary every day. Once the offerings for the people were completed and the Sanctuary was cleansed, the sins were removed by the priest and placed on the head of the scapegoat (symbolic of Satan) who was then taken into the wilderness and released to die. This event typified the cleansing of the Sanctuary, just prior to Jesus’ Second Coming! Daniel was given a prophetic view of this event to come in Daniel 8:13, 14. (See also Leviticus 16:8-10, 26)</p>
<h2>Feast of Tabernacles</h2>
	<p><em>“Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month</em> [Tishri] <em>shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD. On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein. Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.”</em> (Leviticus 23:34-36)</p>
	<p>This was the last of the yearly feasts, a joyous occasion. It required travel to Jerusalem to the central Sanctuary in expression of their thanks to God for His blessings.</p>
	<p>When Jesus has gathered His elect at His second coming this fall feast will meet its antitype. This is the great harvest feast when Jesus has reaped the fruits of the earth. He was the <strong>“firstfruits”</strong>, and His Church will be the final harvest.</p>
	<p><em>“But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.”</em> (1 Corinthians 15:23)</p>
	<p>The Bible plainly shows that with every feast there were offerings, sacrifices, and special <strong>yearly</strong> sabbaths.</p>
	<p><em>“Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day</em> [of the feast] <em>shall be <strong>a sabbath</strong>, and on the eighth day shall be <strong>a sabbath</strong>.”</em> (Leviticus 23:39)</p>
	<p>Again emphasis must be placed on the fact that these feast days were <strong>annual celebrations,</strong> and could not conform to a weekly schedule. The tenth day or fifteenth day of the month might fall on any given day of the week. They were instructed to build booths, or tents, in which they would reside for the week as a reminder of their days in the wilderness.</p>
	<p><em>“Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths: That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</em> (Leviticus 23:40-43)</p>
<h2>The Sacrificial System</h2>
	<p>When Adam and Eve transgressed God’s commandment, sin presented a problem that had to be resolved. In God’s infinite wisdom and love, a plan was devised to save man from sin and its wages of death. According to Peter and John the plan of redemption had already been devised before the foundation of the world. <em>“Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: Who verily was <strong>foreordained before the foundation of the world</strong>, but was manifest in these last times for you.”</em> (1 Peter 1:18-20, see also Revelation 13:8)</p>
	<p>Though ordained before the foundation of the world, Jesus would not actually be offered on the cross for another 4,000 years after Adam’s fall. Therefore, God introduced the types that would point to Christ’s sacrifice for us. <strong>This was done immediately after God promised that He would rescue Adam and Eve from the penalty of death which they had brought upon themselves by their sin of disobedience.</strong> God said to the serpent: <em>“And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.”</em> (Genesis 3:15)</p>
	<p>Satan’s seed is the seed of discontent and hatred by which he has motivated countless angels and people to rebel against God’s church throughout history.</p>
	<p>The woman’s seed is Jesus. The bruising of His heel is an allusion to His death on the cross, a death that would not be able to hold Him. Christ would rise from the dead to bruise the head of Satan. After revealing to Adam and Eve the plan for their rescue from everlasting destruction, one or more animals was slain by the pair typifying the sacrifice of Jesus. <em>“Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.”</em> (Genesis 3:21) Prior to their sin, having been made in the image of God, they had been clothed in light. <em>“Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment:”</em> (Psalm 104:2)</p>
	<p>Try to imagine the depth of anguish Adam and Eve must have experienced as they cut the throat of the innocent lamb(s)! Those unblemished animals were friends who Adam had named and now they must suffer and die for the sins the once holy pair had committed! Think about how they must have wrestled with the mental image presented to them of Jesus, their Creator who would one day have to experience the death penalty they deserved in order to save their lives for eternity!</p>
	<p>In just a few short years, their firstborn, Cain, tried to offer a bloodless sacrifice contrary to instructions and in so doing incurred God’s displeasure.</p>
	<p><em>“And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.”</em> (Genesis 4:3-7)</p>
	<p><em>“And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and <strong>without shedding of blood is no remission</strong>.”</em> [for sin] (Hebrews 9:22)</p>
	<p>Obviously, God had laid out the plan of Salvation, including His moral laws, to Adam and Eve, or He would not have been displeased with Cain for not doing His (God’s) will. Cain knew that blood was required and that there is no blood in vegetables.</p>
	<p>A great many sacrifices were offered prior to God’s selection of Israel as his chosen people. However, after giving the Ten Commandments, God gave Moses a series of Sacrificial Laws along with the scheduling of annual dates for each of the specific events. Moses followed God’s instructions to write these laws in a book. (Please read Deuteronomy 9:9-26 for God’s reason for these laws - <strong>Very important!</strong>) So, under the Mosaic Law, the sacrificial system was organized, structured, and written in a book. This is what Paul referred to as the “handwriting of ordinances.” While the sanctuary services required daily offerings and sacrifices that pointed to Jesus as the Lamb, the yearly feasts pointed to the “Lamb slain from the foundation of the earth.”</p>
	<p>From the particular nature of these instructions, we can see that it was God’s desire to make each requirement reflect His yearning love. God wanted His people to realize:</p>
	<p>1. The sinfulness of sin</p>
	<p>2. How much it would cost Heaven for Jesus to die, shedding His precious blood in order to save them, and</p>
	<p>3. The unfolding story of the entire plan of redemption.</p>
	<p>The Redeemer’s plan was to use every element of the services to internalize the plan of salvation so deeply in the people’s minds that it would be a constant reminder to them of their need and of Christ’s incredibly merciful, upcoming provision to rescue them for everlasting life. The killing of the animals represented Jesus’ Sacrificial death. The blood represented His life freely poured out for them. The food and drink items consumed were emblematic of acceptance by the people of His sacrifice.</p>
<h2>Israel’s Failure</h2>
	<p>All of those services and the symbols of the coming Redeemer‘s sacrifice and His merciful, loving, and ongoing watch-care were to be ever before their minds. However, even while practicing these reminders, the Israelites lost the meaning and importance of the feast days and thus distorted their application by drifting into idol worship. This resulted in God’s fierce denunciation of Israel and their perverted feasts.</p>
	<p><em>“Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness. I will also cause all her mirth to cease, <strong>her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts</strong>. And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them. And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.”</em> (Hosea 2:9-13)</p>
	<p>Paul spoke forcefully to the members of the Colossian church and decried the efforts of those who wanted to continue those ordinances, saying (in paraphrase), “Don’t let anyone deceive you in matters of eating, drinking, feast days and such, saying that you should continue to observe them, because Christ has already become the promised sacrifice. Therefore, they now are meaningless.”</p>
	<p>When Christ died on the cross, His death became the reality which cast the shadows all the way back to Eden. It covered the transgressions of all who would accept His substitutionary death as payment for their sins. Continuing these rituals would, in effect, demonstrate either disbelief in the efficacy (power to produce an effect) of His sacrifice or disbelief that He was, in fact, the Savior. It ended the entire need for animal sacrifices! It also ended the necessity for the occasions of the sacrificial feast days. Type had met antitype.</p>
	<p>Before we leave Colossians 2:16, here are some quotes from the commentaries of a few celebrated theologians concerning this verse. (All three quotations are taken from <em>Power Bible CD,</em> Online Publishing, Inc.)</p>
	<p>The first is from Adam Clarke (Methodist): “There is no intimation here that the Sabbath was done away, or that its moral use was superseded, by the introduction of Christianity.”</p>
	<p>Next is a statement from Matthew Henry (English Non-conformist): “Here is a caution to take heed of Judaizing teachers, or those who would impose upon Christians the yoke of the ceremonial law: Let no man therefore judge you in meat nor drink... Colossians 2:16.”</p>
	<p>Finally, Albert Barnes (Presbyterian): “The word Sabbath in the Old Testament is applied not only to the seventh day, but to all the days of holy rest that were observed by Hebrews, and particularly to the beginning and close of their the great festivals. There is doubtless, reference to those days in this place... There is not the slightest reason to believe that he meant to teach that one of the Ten Commandments had ceased to be binding on mankind.”</p>
<h3>Colossians 2:17</h3>
	<p>Paul asserted that these sacrifices were a <em><strong>“shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.”</strong></em> What had been a shadow, became a reality. The seventh day Sabbath was not included in this, however, for it was not a shadow of things to come, but a memorial of creation.</p>
<h3>Colossians 2:18-19</h3>
	<p>Here is a characterization of some who were trying to fool these new converts. Their pretended humility and their apparent worship of angels gave the other new converts the impression that they might not be able to worship God directly. Conviction of this error would rob the fledgling Christian of the privilege of a one-on-one relationship with his Creator. Paul contradicted those fallacious beliefs in his letter to the Hebrews.</p>
	<p><em>“Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.”</em> (Hebrews 10:19-20)</p>
	<p>Paul declared that those unholy people were actually puffed up with their own pride, saying that these pompous people were not recognizing Christ as the Head of the church, who kept it all together, and provided for the increase.</p>
<h3>Colossians 2:20-23</h3>
	<p>Now Paul asked the question, (in paraphrase) “If you are dead with Christ from the rudiments (elements, or principles) of the world, why do you want to be subject to these ordinances? Why would you again place yourselves under the “taste not, touch not, and handle not ordinances, all of which will perish with the using, just like the other requirements which man developed”?</p>
	<p>All of these <strong>only appear</strong> to be what God requires. They <strong>look</strong> as if they are wise, <strong>appear</strong> to include humility, and through their neglect of the body, <strong>seem</strong> to have no desire to satisfy the flesh. Such man-made rules will never strengthen the inner man; they only bring oneself and others into bondage to false ideas and impressions.</p>
<h2>Colossians Three</h2>
<h3>Colossians 3:1-4</h3>
	<p>Paul referred to their baptism as a death to self, after which they should set their hearts on heaven. Rather than the rudiments of the world their focus needed to be on Christ who is seated on the right hand of God. In so doing, they would be safe for eternity.</p>
<h3>Colossians 3:5-15</h3>
	<p>Here the readers of Paul’s letter learn that they are to mortify (put to death) all the deeds that they were formerly involved in which would incur God’s wrath. Instead, Paul counseled them to “put on the new man,” renewed by the Creator. He reminded them that in Christ there is no longer any difference among His people. Love all mankind and forgive them when wronged. They must have tender mercy to all and allow the peace of God to rule in their hearts.</p>
<h3>Colossians 3:16-17</h3>
	<p>The word of God was to be their teacher and guide in all they did. The Scriptures were to abide in their hearts and minds empowering them to live godly lives. This was to be accompanied with thanks to Him who had redeemed them from sin and death.</p>
<h3>Colossians 3:18-25</h3>
	<p>Paul gave them instructions concerning inter-family relationships in order to remove focus on one gender or age group. He wanted them to realize that they were all (servants included) part of the body of Christ. Service was to be offered as if serving God instead of men. It was His goal that believers realize that their reward for either good works or bad would come from God. By diligent, dedicated work, they would be representatives of Christ and witnesses of His love and character. To emphasize this next point, Paul introduces the next class of people (masters) with the preface (paraphrased), “God doesn’t have a higher regard for one person than for another, regardless of their earthly status.”</p>
<h2>Colossians Four</h2>
<h3>Colossians 4:1</h3>
	<p>Paul said to the masters, “remember that you too, have a master, God in heaven. Treat your servants as you would want to be treated”.</p>
<h3>Colossians 4:2-4</h3>
	<p>He asked that the members continue in thankful prayer for themselves watching prayerfully that they not fall into any of the aforementioned snares. Since he is still imprisoned, he solicited their prayers that he might again have the opportunity to continue his speaking ministry outside of the prison.</p>
<h3>Colossians 4:5-6</h3>
	<p>Church members were admonished to treat those unbelieving interests carefully, with wisdom, knowing how to give an answer for their faith and to make the most of every opportunity to evangelize them. They were to also be mindful of their own speech. It was always to be tempered with Christian love and flavored with the salt that was within them. (Mark 9:50) God’s hope was that through His grace each one would know how to answer any questions others might ask them.</p>
<h3>Colossians 4:7-14</h3>
	<p>In his closing statement, Paul endorsed a number of members of the church. He began with Tychicus, whom he calls a beloved brother, faithful minister (possibly the pastor of the church), and fellow servant in the Lord, who apparently, along with Onesimus, (former slave-read the book of Philemon for details) delivered this letter to the church. Next he mentioned Aristarchus, a fellow Jewish prisoner, who wanted to say hello to the Colossians. Then he asked that Marcus (also a Jew) who was Barnabas’ nephew, be received by the church. Paul may have wanted to dissolve any enmity that there night have been toward Marcus because of the controversy between himself and Barnabas during an earlier missionary trip. (Acts 15:36-39) Also included is Justus, a believing Jew. Paul declared that all these men had been a comfort to him. Then he praised Epaphras and commended him for his labors for the churches, not only at Colossae, but also those at Hierapolis and Laodicea. This diligent work was to prepare the characters of the members to stand morally pure before the throne of God. Paul extended greetings from “the beloved physician Luke” and Demas who apparently later forsook the church. (2 Timothy 4:10)</p>
<h3>Colossians 4:15</h3>
	<p>In the early church, the meetings were held in homes due to of a lack of church buildings. There must have been some kind of building used by the church in Laodicea that may have been too small for the members, thus Nymphas offered his house as a meeting place for the church.</p>
<h3>Colossians 4:16</h3>
	<p>Paul asked the church at Colossae to make sure to share this letter with the church at Laodicea and to read a letter that he had evidently sent earlier to the Laodiceans. For some reason, the Lord has seen fit not to preserve this letter.</p>
<h3>Colossians 4:17</h3>
	<p>Archippus was urged to fulfill the ministry that he had begun. This is a lesson for all of us! No one should forsake any task which the Lord has given us to do. Oh how many jobs are left undone!</p>
<h3>Colossians 4:18</h3>
	<p>In closing, Paul asked that the church to remember that he is in prison. His salutation was written in his own handwriting whereas the letter itself was written by Timothy or another of Paul’s companions.</p>
<h2>Crucial Observations</h2>
<h3>Circumcision</h3>
	<p>From Adam to Abraham, there was no circumcision, therefore it was not a requirement for salvation. It was given to Abraham and extended to all of the children of Israel. (Read Genesis 17)</p>
	<p>But to Abraham it was even more poignant! He was ninety-nine years old and Sarah was 90, both well beyond child bearing age. Circumcision was representative of Abraham’s acceptance of God’s covenant (promise) to make Abraham the father of as many children as there were stars in the heavens. His progeny, including Moses and the children of Israel, took part in this agreement by their participation as well. Additionally, it was through the seed of Abraham that the Redeemer was to come.</p>
	<p>No doubt the rite was to resonate with God’s people on several levels, because it contained multiple symbolisms. Abraham’s circumcision was a rejection of self and his recognition of God’s omniscience (infinite knowledge). It signified the cutting away of self—of whatever covered up, obstructed, defiled, and/or separated mankind from God. It was to eliminate false pride (self confidence) by recognizing God’s Omnipotence (Infinite power)! It was necessarily performed on the man, because man was <strong>the priest, teacher, and guide for his family</strong>, and as such was the one to ratify the covenant for his family. (See Genesis 17:11)</p>
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: It could be said that women were signatory to the covenant through their husband because when they were married they became “one flesh” according to Genesis 2:24! A single woman may have received the “heart circumcision” spoken of in Deuteronomy 30:6, quoted below. (At that point in history it is probable that there were few women, if any, of marriageable age who were unmarried.)</p>
	<p>Jesus’ blood at His crucifixion replaced the symbolic blood of animals, thereby ratifying His part of the covenant, making it unnecessary for the practice to continue!</p>
	<p>God’s people needed to grasp the significance of circumcision in order to process the idea of “circumcision of the heart.” Consideration of what circumcision represented was <strong>always to bring about a heartfelt response</strong>. It was not just to be a mechanical, legalistic, or unemotional act. Here is Old Testament proof of that!</p>
	<p><em>“And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.”</em> (Deuteronomy 30:6)</p>
	<p><em>“Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.”</em> (Jeremiah 4:4)</p>
	<p>Removal of selfish desires produces the “clean heart” which David wrote about (Psalms 51:10), which brought him to the place where he could repeatedly declare, “Oh, how I love thy law”. (Psalms 119:97, 98, 113, 163) Thus, the law was written on his heart! <strong>By following its dictates using the power provided by God, he was protected from evil (and its consequences)</strong>. In the New Testament this is the heart that God writes His law upon. God’s moral instruction to the new Christian Church was unchanged from those given in the Old Testament. It is a heart that relies on the word of God rather than self!</p>
	<p><em>“For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:”</em> (Hebrews 8:10)</p>
	<p><em>“In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.”</em> (Colossians 2:11)</p>
	<p><em>“Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.”</em> (1 Corinthians 7:19)</p>
	<p><em>“Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.”</em> (Romans 3:30)</p>
	<p>The ‘new covenant’ was the same as the old covenant except that it was ratified by Better Blood—that of Jesus Christ!</p>
<h3>The Law - Fulfilled</h3>
	<p>Is it not reasonable for The Lord God, creator of all the universe, who caused the world to be suspended in space and move in their proper orbits, according to His plan, to have laws which govern His government? Wouldn’t these laws be created out of His great heart of love, and wouldn’t they be designed to protect all of His created beings, especially those who love Him? What sense would it make for Him to destroy those very laws that were designed to create a harmony of love in the universe? Jesus said during His Sermon on the mount:</p>
	<p><em>“Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.”</em> (Matthew 5:17-18)</p>
	<p>Remember that Jesus made this statement right after declaring that “<em>Man cannot live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”</em> (Matthew 4:4)</p>
	<p>Question: Does “fulfill” mean to “do away with”? If so, then the verse would mean “I am not come to destroy the law, but to do away with it. Does that make sense at all? Of course not! Has heaven and earth passed away? —No!</p>
	<p>What did Paul mean when he asked the people of Philippi to <em>“Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind”</em>? (Philippians 2:2) Did Paul want his joy done away with?</p>
	<p>Fulfill means to <strong>“meet the requirements.”</strong> If I am traveling at the posted speed limit, or paying my taxes, I am fulfilling the requirements of those laws!</p>
	<p>Did Jesus meet the requirements of the Sacrificial Laws, or those of the Moral law–the Ten Commandments? The answer is that <strong>He absolutely met them both!</strong> The Sacrificial Laws required the violator to pay with his life for his own sin. Jesus accepted the penalty deserved by all mankind by paying the cost in full at the cross.</p>
	<p><em>“For the wages</em> [earnings] <em>of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”</em> (Romans 6:23, see also Ezekiel 18:4)</p>
	<p>Jesus fulfilled the Ten Commandments by keeping them all–perfectly–and tells us, <em>“If you love me, keep my commandments.”</em> (John 14:15) And He provides the power to do so through His Holy Spirit.</p>
	<p>Neither of those laws was done away with! The Sacrificial Laws are set aside, no longer being useful, because the requirements have been met once for all.</p>
	<p>Here is an illustration of this concept:</p>
	<p>While growing up, Johnny formulated several plans for his future. He wanted to get his college education, find the perfect wife, purchase a home, and have children. His attention to the development of these plans resulted in their accomplishment. His overall goal of a successful career and family was reached.</p>
	<p>When Johnny completed his education, was that part of the plan fulfilled? Yes. Was it done away with? Or was it looked back on with satisfaction, and used to his advantage in the future? The answer is clear. The other steps in his plan were as well thought out and beneficial as the first one had been.</p>
	<p>In much the same way, the ceremonial laws were not abolished, but fulfilled in Jesus Christ with the overall goal of reconciling us to God and bringing us into harmony with His moral law so that we may be able to live with Him eternally! He has plans for us to give us an expected end. (Jeremiah 29:11)</p>
	<p><em>“Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law; Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away</em> [not by obliterating, but by setting it aside as having been accomplished] <em>the first, that he may establish the second. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all... This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them.”</em> (Hebrews 10:8-10, 16)</p>
<h3>What About Grace?</h3>
	<p>Grandpa (and others) called grandma by her actual name, “Grace.” At meal time, we were told to “fold our hands, bow our heads,” and say grace! No-one ever said “grace.” Eventually I understood.</p>
	<p>What do we understand today about grace? Considering the complexity of our modern day language and the various usages of the word, do we really understand what Biblical grace is?</p>
	<p>The dictionary lists many meanings for the word grace.</p>
	<p>1. The saying of a prayer of thanks before or after a meal.</p>
	<p>2. Beauty of form or attitude, or ease and elegance of speech.</p>
	<p>3. Any excellence or attractive characteristic, quality or endowment.</p>
	<p>4. Unmerited favor or goodwill; any clemency; hence any kindness, favor, or service freely rendered.</p>
	<p>5. Something granted in the exercise of a favor or discretion and not as of right.</p>
	<p>6. A courteous or gracious demeanor; graciousness; demeanor in general.</p>
	<p>7. In music, an ornament or embellishment as a trill, turn or the like.</p>
	<p>8. Physical virtue or efficiency.</p>
	<p>9. <u>In theology, the unmerited love and favor of God in Christ; hence, free gift; the divine influence acting within the heart, to regenerate, sanctify, and keep it; a state of reconciliation to God through Christ; the power or disposition to exercise saving faith, and to live the Christian life; any spiritual gift or attainment</u>.</p>
	<p>Some editions probably include something like this: “Grace period” extra time granted beyond a deadline to pay or perform specified contract obligations.</p>
	<p>Focusing on the theological definition, we can determine several factors that should aid our understanding of the Bible meaning. Let’s extract the components of the theological definition above.</p>
	<p>God’s grace is not something deserved, it is a free gift! It provides a regenerative, sanctifying effect on the heart, leading to reconciliation to Himself, through Jesus Christ! <u>It gives us a disposition to exercise saving faith, and power to live the Christian life</u>! All of the above are freely given to those who, in faith, sincerely and prayerfully seek them with a heart full of repentance for disobeying God. We can see that conformance to God’s perfect plans for mankind will result in eternal happiness!</p>
	<p>Because God’s grace is an outworking of His love, it permeates the entire universe! It is evident in His creation, in the ongoing life support systems, in His provision of all of life’s physical enhancements, including food, water, sunshine, and fresh air, and all the beauty which surrounds us. Also, His grace gives us the ability to think, earn a living, and to pursue countless enjoyments! Death is the only way grace can be entirely avoided, and death comes from Satan—not God!</p>
	<p>Until sin entered the world, no shortage of God’s grace existed in animal, mineral, or vegetable! Then an extra special grace—<u>saving grace</u>—prepared in advance by the Godhead, became necessary! It was ready to rescue mankind from certain death. Disobedience had separated Adam and Eve from God’s life support! This special grace is available in ever increasing quantities to those willing to receive it. Four important points to consider concerning grace are:</p>
	<p>1. God’s saving grace can be rejected by anyone at any time! The Israelites finally exhausted God’s grace by their sins, and we can do likewise!</p>
	<p>2. It isn’t a license to continue in the sin which occasioned the need for His grace; this would be presumptuous!</p>
	<p>3. God’s grace cannot be earned!</p>
	<p>4. It doesn’t remove the need to keep God’s commandments!</p>
<h3>So, what is the relationship between grace and sin?</h3>
	<p>NOTE: God’s love is demonstrated in His justice as well as in His grace (mercy)!</p>
	<p>Once sin entered the world, it was imperative that mankind become aware of the danger that they would encounter if they <u>continued</u> in sin. Because the risk was eternal separation from God, He gave them all of His laws to make them fully aware of the <u>limits</u> of His saving grace.</p>
	<p>These laws were like a fence around mankind, to alert them to impending danger. Because God knew the frailty of His children (Psalms 103:14), He applied His own “grace period.” Additionally, He gave another gracious gift to them—the Holy Spirit, which would speak to their conscience when they began to be tempted to sin. They were free to make their own choices! Would they obey God or follow their own inclinations? Those who continually choose to disobey cannot receive this saving grace! Would it be justice for the victims if <u>unrepentant</u> mass-murderers, or rapists were to receive this grace? Further, would those who have formed lifestyles based on their own desires, be happy in a heavenly existence?</p>
	<p>According to Proverbs 14:12, <em>“There is a way which <u>seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death</u>!”</em> However, <em>“The Lord…is not willing that any should perish, but that <u>all should come to repentance</u>.”</em> (2 Peter 3:9)</p>
	<p>Look again at Matthew 4:4 where Jesus quoted Deuteronomy 8:3. He said that <em>“man should live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”</em> Then in John 14:15 He said, <em>“If you love me keep my commandments.”</em></p>
	<p>With all this in mind, let us look at a much quoted (usually only partially) and little understood Bible passage.</p>
	<p><em>“<u>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body</u>, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. <u>For sin shall not have dominion over you</u>: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. <u>What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</u> Know ye not, that <u>to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness</u>?”</em> (Romans 6:13-16)</p>
	<p>Paraphrase: “I am ‘under’ <u>the condemnation</u> of the law when I sin, but if I ask for forgiveness and conform to God’s holy law, my guilt is forgiven and I am ‘under God’s grace!’ <u>I am not free to ‘continue in sin!’</u>” Paul most emphatically says, <em>“God forbid”</em>!</p>
	<p>Here’s what Paul said to the members of the church at Galatia:</p>
	<p><em>“I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. <u>I do not frustrate the grace of God</u>: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.”</em> (Galatians 2:20,21)</p>
	<p>Paraphrase: “By faith I have surrendered myself to Christ and invited Him to live in my heart and direct my life. I am no longer attempting to save myself, thereby preventing (frustrating) the reception of God’s gift of <u>saving grace</u>.”</p>
	<p>The most remarkable example of God’s <u>personal and sacrificial saving grace</u> is revealed in the voluntary surrender of His precious Son, Jesus, our Creator, to endure the death penalty that we deserve! Just in coming to this dark and fiercely wicked world is, in itself, an incredible example of God’s grace! Jesus’ mission was to teach the world about the love (justice and mercy) His Father had for mankind. Christ’s unbelievably cruel death on the cross at Calvary was <u>payment for our sins</u>! <u>It also demonstrated that His Royal Law could not be changed. Could it have been changed, Jesus need not have died</u>!</p>
	<p>Consider what should be our <u>goal</u> according to the apostle John:</p>
	<p><em>“My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye <u>sin not</u>. And [but] if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:”</em> (1 John 2:1)</p>
	<p>The Holy Spirit speaks to us whenever we are tempted. Power to overcome the temptation is offered, by His grace, to all who ask!</p>
	<p>Each time we do not obey this voice from God, our ability <strong><u>to hear</u></strong> His voice is damaged, until finally we are no longer able to hear His voice. (Parents may understand this grief, as their children “turn them off.”)</p>
	<p>Paul warns us... <em>“And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption!”</em> (Ephesians 4:30)</p>
	<p>Jesus pleads with us to surrender to Him in order to come “under His grace” so that He can provide us with even more grace—eternally!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>It is easy to see with certainty that Paul was, in this letter and in his letter to the church at Ephesus (see below), referring to practices that were no longer necessary! Type had met anti-type! Jesus said from the cross, <em>“It is finished!”</em></p>
	<p><em>“Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain</em> [Jew and Gentile] <em>one new man, so making peace.”</em> (Ephesians 2:15)</p>
	<p>The sacrificial system was designed to foreshadow the redemption from their sins through the blood of the Lamb of God. This system had reached its fulfillment! To continue to observe these ceremonies indicated disbelief in the efficacy of His blood or even that Jesus was the Savior! The days that were provided for the sacrifices themselves have no separate significance. Since this was the case, there would be no justification for trying to apply the words of Colossians 2:16-17 to the early church. <strong>Note:</strong> Three of these feasts: Feasts of Unleavened Bread, Weeks, and Tabernacles, <strong>required travel to Jerusalem and the participation of a priest</strong>, something that would be impossible today! (Exodus 34:23)</p>
	<p>Finally, what were the disciples given to remind them, and ultimately us, of His sacrifice? Paul wrote this:</p>
	<p><em>“For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: <strong>this do in remembrance of me</strong>. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, <strong>as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord’s death till he come</strong>.”</em> (1 Corinthians 11:24-26)</p>
	<p>This service is called the Ordinance of Humility. Jesus, LORD of All, “who thought it not robbery to be equal with God” (Philippians 2:6), who also described Himself as “meek and lowly in heart” (Matthew 11:29), who girded Himself, took the part of a servant, and washed the disciples’ feet. Then, His Servanthood took Him to Calvary to die for you and for me!</p>
	<p>The adversary is busily trying to encourage us to embark on a course of self promotion and pride (if we’re not already on that trip). Instead, we need to continually realize that we are valueless without Jesus. Eternal life can only be secured as we, minute by minute, look to Him in faith, and trust Him for the power to be changed into His image!</p>
	<p><em>“There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.”</em> (Proverbs 16:25)</p>
	<p>Two verses have been a great help to me, and I hope they might be to you as well especially in times of great accomplishment or when you are depressed. Here they are:</p>
	<p><em>“… let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.”</em> (Isaiah 27:5)</p>
	<p><em>“Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.”</em> (Isaiah 26:3)</p>
	<p>Finally, there is a sacrifice for us to make:</p>
	<p><em>“<strong>Humble yourselves</strong> therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.”</em> (1 Peter 5:6-9)</p>

<h2>None of Self and All of Thee</h2>
	<p>Oh, the bitter pain and sorrow</br/>
	That a time could ever be,<br/>
	When I proudly said to Jesus,<br/>
	"All of self, and none of Thee."</h6>

	<p>Yet He found me; I beheld Him<br/>
	Bleeding on the accursed tree,<br/>
	And my wistful heart said faintly,<br/>
	"Some of self, and some of Thee."</p>

	<p>Day by Day His tender mercy,<br/>
	Healing, helping, full and free,<br/>
	Brought me lower while I whispered,<br/>
	"Less of self, and more of Thee."</p>

	<p>Higher than the highest heaven,<br/>
	Deeper than the deepest sea,<br/>
	Lord, Thy love at last has conquered:<br/>
	"<em>None</em> of self, and <em>all</em> of Thee."</p>
