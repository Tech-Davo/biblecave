<h1>Does The Bible Teach An Ever-Burning Hell?</h1>
<h3>by Jay Cap</h3>	
<br/>

<div id="Section1" dir="LTR">
<h3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>
<p>In realization of the fact that—</p>
<p>“<em>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” James 1:17 —</em></p>
<p>I have humbly sought His leading in the preparation of this study. Therefore all the credit belongs to Him, for without Him I can do nothing! (John 15:5)</p>
<p>However, He has also blessed me with assistance from others of His children to help me.</p>
<p>Firstly, Mr. Allen Barnes, who himself is an author of several books. He is also a good friend and brother in Christ, has helped me with proof reading and the arrangement of the booklet for printing. He has provided me with valuable material both by addition, or through correction, which helped to bring clarity!</p>
<p>Mr. Brent Yocum, who also proofread the material.</p>
<p>My other and best half, my wife Alice, who has been my constant support for the 54 years of our marriage.</p>
<p>I dedicate the effort to Renae, my barber, who provided the impetus for writing it!</p>

<h3><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h3>
<p>This study examines the Bible teaching on the subject of hellfire, including events leading up to it, its duration, and then the end of it! The purpose of the study is to reveal that, although the Hell experience will not be a pleasant one, the amount of suffering each person endures will be determined by the extent of his or her deeds in opposition to God’s will while on this earth! Jesus Himself declared:</p>
<p><em>“And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.”</em> Revelation 22:12.</p>
<p>Why must we know the truth about this “Ever-Burning Hell” question? There are a number of important reasons:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Because we need to know what all truth is, so that we’re not deceived.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li>
		<p>Because millions of folks have been “turned off” from religion by the mistaken idea that God is maliciously going to continually torment those who dare to reject Him.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li>
		<p>Further, some people don’t realize the necessity for GOD to put a stop to evil at some point, in order to protect the universe(s). An “ever-burning Hell” would perpetuate evil by reminding the inhabitants of this and other worlds of it.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
	<li>
		<p>That this cleansing by fire is actually an act of mercy, due to God’s great heart of incredible LOVE! It rescues those who have been subjected to the evil that has surrounded them, while putting those who are irrevocably embroiled in the misery of sin, by (or through) their own choosing, out of their misery!</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<div id="Section5" dir="LTR">
<p>Note: GOD only requires us to take action when it is for our best good!</p>

<h3><a name="study">Study Materials</a></h3>
<p>Our study employs the King James Bible (KJV) and Strong’s Concordance. The reason for using these particular materials is that they are coordinated. The KJV is the basis of the Strong’s Concordance, every word of this version being found in Strong’s along with the original Hebrew or Greek word from which the translation was made. If you use a different Bible version, you won’t be able to use this concordance to discover the meanings of many Bible words.</p>
<p>There are around 1,500 Bible translations and paraphrases now, and new ones are appearing all the time! Additionally, every time a publisher wants to bring a new version to the market, they must change at least 15% of the wording in order to get a copyright. That, in addition to the above reason, is why we are using the KJV. Also, the reader might do well to find older concordances, because publishers have been, and are, making changes in the newer versions in order to accommodate modern religious thinking, and are making new source materials that harmonize with these new beliefs.</p>
<p>Alright, put on your explorer’s hat, and let’s begin!</p>

<h3><a name="word">Word Interpretations and Meanings</a></h3>
<p>To start our study, let us look at the words that translators had to work with in the original languages—Hebrew in the Old Testament, and Greek in the New Testament. Let’s also give them a little slack, realizing that meanings of words have changed over the centuries.</p>
<p>We are looking first at the Hebrew and Greek words from which the word “Hell” has been translated. We will discover that the meanings are different from our modern English definitions. From there we will proceed to the three Hebrew words that are translated “forever” and their meanings. In the chart that follows, we will read actual verses that contain the word “forever,” or, “for ever,” from the Old Testament, in order to determine if those usages make sense in the context of the verses themselves. Afterward, we will look at the same information in the New Testament using the Greek words.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section6" dir="LTR">
<p>Perhaps the reader is wondering what the purpose of the word exercise below is. That purpose is this: It will show that the translators had a variety of words to use. What they wound up using was dependant on meanings current in their time, as well as in some cases, perhaps, filtering the words through their own beliefs. Our desire is to compare the original word meanings with our own present day meanings. We also want to approach the study with an open mind, asking for the guidance of the Holy Spirit as promised in His Word.</p>
<p>“<em>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.”</em> John 16:13<em>.</em></p>

<h3><a name="othell">The Old Testament Word for “Hell”</a></h3>
<p>The only Hebrew word translated “Hell” is <em>sheol</em> (sheh-ole’). Although sheol appears 65 times in the Old Testament, it is only translated “hell” in 31 of those places, four of which have a marginal reading of “the grave.” It is also translated “grave” 31 times, but if you include the four marginal renderings, it would total 35 times. It is three times translated “pit,” but in each of those, the grave or hole in the earth is obviously meant. Where it has been translated “hell,” in the great majority of cases the word “grave” would have been just as plausible.</p>
<p>Sheol is the destiny of all mankind, not just the wicked. It was where Jacob and Job expected to go.</p>
<p>“<em>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave</em> [sheol]<em>, whither thou goest.” </em>Ecclesiastes 9:10.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section7" dir="LTR">
<p>“<em>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave</em> [sheol]<em> unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.” </em>Genesis 37:35.</p>
<p>“<em>O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave </em>[sheol]<em>, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!”</em> Job 14:13.</p>

<h3><a name="nthell">The New Testament Words for “Hell”</a></h3>
<p>There are three words translated “Hell” in the New Testament. Below are the words and meanings.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p><em>Geenna </em>(Gheh’-en-nah)—a small valley just outside the<em> </em>city of Jerusalem, used as the city dump!</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Due to the heat produced by gasses from the decaying material, and the destruction by burning down of material in order to make room for more dumping, there is a continual smoke rising from the site! Jesus uses this in a figurative sense, because of the smell, maggots and worms, it created a very distasteful image in the minds of the people! (See Matthew 5:22 for one such use.)</p>
<ol start="2">
	<li>
		<p><em>Hades </em>(Hah’-dace, but generally pronounced Hay’deez)—<em> </em>the unseen place or state of the dead! (See Matthew 11:23 and Revelation 20:14 for such use.) Note that in the latter verse, we see that it is both Death and Hell that are destroyed in the fire at the end of the world!</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li>
		<p><em>Tartaroo </em>(Tar-tar-o’-o)—The deepest abyss of Hades<em> </em>(see its only occurrence in 2 Peter 2:4). If this is a place of burning and torment where the fallen angels are imprisoned, someone must have left the keys in the door, for evil angels (demons or devils) are running rampant through the earth. The word must refer to our fallen planet where Satan and his hosts are quarantined from the rest of the universe. Eventually this earth will melt with fervent heat (2 Peter 3:10, 12).</p>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="Section8" dir="LTR">
<h3><a name="otever">The Old Testament Words for “For Ever”</a></h3>
<p>The following are the Hebrew words that have been translated into “forever,” or “for ever,” in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>NOTE: These Hebrew and Greek words listed are actually the alphabetical equivalents in English, followed by pronunciations given in the concordance, because I don’t have the characters on my keyboard to do otherwise. And if you are like me, you probably couldn’t read the Greek or Hebrew, anyway. But don’t worry, it is only important to recognize them. You don’t even need to pronounce them.</p>
<p>h5769 `owlam or o-lawm’. The English meanings that the translators came up with include: forever, ever, everlasting, old, perpetual, evermore, never, time, ancient, world, alway, long, more, never+ the vanishing point + time out of mind, misc.</p>
<p>h5331 netsach or neh’-tsakh. The English meanings they came up with for this word are: a goal, a bright object at a distance, traveled toward, splendor or confidence, but usually continually, to the most distant point of view, always constantly, end, ever (more), perpetual, strength, and victory.</p>
<p>h5703 ‘ad or ad. The English meanings they came up with are: as long, hitherto, when, how long, as yet. Example: Job 19:24.</p>
<p>NOTE: The h5769 (etc.) numbers above, allow searchers to locate a referred word by number in Strong’s Concordance, rather than to find it alphabetically. Some other study tools such as Lexicons, Dictionaries and Concordances will use these same numbers for comparisons. They are also used in cross referencing. Often the word in the concordance will refer to another number, indicating a source word. We won’t use these numbers in the rest of this study.</p>
<p>Some of the meanings of the words “forever” or “for ever” in these verses are, as you will see, inconsistent with our understanding of these words today.</p>
</div>
	
<div id="Section9" dir="LTR">
<p>Genesis 13:15–All of the land to become Israel’s to be theirs “for ever.” Is it still theirs?</p>
<p>Genesis 43:9–Until Jacob’s son Judah died. Is Judah still living?</p>
<p>Genesis 44:32–Judah was a hostage (forever) to assure that Joseph’s father came to Egypt! Is he still a prisoner?</p>
<p>Exodus 19:9–The length of time the Israelites believed the words God gave Moses.</p>
<p>Exodus 21:6–A hole in the ear of a servant made him a servant for ever! How long is that? Are those servants still serving their masters?</p>
<p>Exodus 27:21–Aaron and his descendants to have charge of the Sanctuary “for ever unto their generations,” and according to the next text, they could not enter the Holy Place having iniquity! The penalty? Death. (Exodus 28:43) They would also die if they failed to wash their hands and feet. (Exodus 30:21) Are these requirements still in place?</p>
<p>Leviticus 6:18–Priests to eat of unleavened bread. Are they still doing that?</p>
<p>Leviticus 7:34-36–Wave offering breast to be given to the priest to eat. Are they still receiving it and eating it?</p>
<p>Leviticus 17:7–Israel was to stop offering to idols for ever. Did they obey?</p>
<p>Leviticus 25:23–Land not to be sold for ever, it is mine saith the Lord. What has happened to that land?</p>
<p>1st Samuel 1:22–Hannah gave Samuel to the Lord forever. Is he still serving?</p>
<p>1st Samuel 2:32, 35–Not supposed to be an old man in an Israelite house forever. Really?</p>
<p>1st Kings 8:13–The house that Solomon built for God was to be His dwelling place “for ever”! Is God still living there?</p>
</div>

<div id="Section10" dir="LTR">
<p>1st Kings 9:5–God established His throne at Israel for ever. Is it still there?</p>
<p>2nd Kings 5:25, 27–Leprosy in Gehazi’s family to be for ever. Is that still the case?</p>
<p>2nd Chronicles 33:7–God to put His name on Solomon’s temple for ever. Is it still there?</p>
<p>In this chart below, we will look at the various ways and number of times the Hebrew word ‘owlam has been translated.</p>

<p>For this next part of the study, you will see some verses with the words in bold type, followed by either the numeral 1 or 2. Those words followed by the number 1 are translated from the Hebrew word ‘owlam. Those followed by the numeral 2 are from the Hebrew word ‘ad. (See meanings in the box on	page 9.)</p>
<p>Here are some of the texts that contain translations from the original words. Note that <strong>not all of the Bible occurrences of “forever” or “for ever” are covered in this study!</strong></p>
</div>

<div id="Section11" dir="LTR">
<p>“<em>And the LORD said, My spirit shall not <strong>always</strong> </em>(1)<em> strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.”</em> Genesis 6:3-4.</p>
<p>“<em>There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were <strong>of old</strong></em> (1)<em>, men of renown.” </em>Genesis 6:4.</p>
<p>“<em>And God said, this is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for	<strong>perpetual</strong></em> (1)<em> generations:” </em>Genesis 9:12.</p>
<p>“<em>The LORD shall reign <strong>for ever</strong></em> (1)<em> and <strong>ever</strong></em> (2)<em>.” </em>Exodus 15:18.</p>
<p>“<em>Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem <strong>at any time</strong></em> (1)<em>.”</em> Leviticus 25:32.</p>
<p>“<em>Remember the days </em><em><strong>of old</strong></em><em> </em>(1)<em>, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.”</em> Deuteronomy 32:7.</p>
<p>“<em>And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap </em><em><strong>for ever</strong></em><em> </em>(1)	<em>, even a desolation unto this day.” </em>Joshua 8:28.</p>

<p>“<em>And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations <strong>for 2 evermore</strong></em> (1)<em>.” </em>Psalms 106:31.</p>
		
<h3><a name="ntever">The New Testament Words for “For Ever”</a></h3>
<p>Forever is divided into two words, for and ever. The Greek word for “for” is <em>eis</em> (pronounced “ice”). It is defined as: “to or into (indicating the point reached or entered).”</p>
</div>

<div id="Section12" dir="LTR">
<p>Often the Greek word for “ever” is <em>aion</em> (pronounced ahee-ohn’), and it is defined as: “properly, an age; by extension, perpetuity (also past); by implication, the world.”</p>
<p>So the correct meaning of the two words together is <strong>“to a</strong>	<strong>point reached in the ages.” </strong>Depending on the context of the<strong> </strong>verse, the exact intent of the writer must be determined. Here are some verses with these words:</p>
<p>“<em>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, <strong>for ever.</strong> Amen.”</em> Matthew 6:13.</p>
<p>“<em>To whom be glory <strong>for ever and ever</strong></em> [eis aion aion]<em>, Amen.” </em>Galatians 1:5.</p>
<p>“<em>And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up <strong>for ever and ever </strong></em>[eis aion aion] <em>: and they have no rest day nor	night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.” Revelation 14:11.</em></p>
<p>The expression “for ever and ever” in the two texts above is translated from the same Greek words, “eis” and “aion”, with the “aion” being repeated; in other words, “eis aion aion.” Bible writers commonly repeated words to add emphasis or importance. For examples, see Isaiah 6:3 and Revelation 4:8 where we find “Holy, Holy, Holy.”</p>
<p>“<em>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him <strong>for ever</strong>.” </em>Philemon 1:15.</p>
<p><strong>This raises a question</strong>: Did Paul expect Philemon, the owner of the slave, Onesimus, to keep him as a slave throughout eternity? Obviously, “the point reached at in the ages” would be, at most, the lifetime of either of the two individuals!</p>
<p>“<em>But this man, </em>[Jesus]<em> after he had offered one sacrifice for sins <strong>for ever</strong>, sat down on the right hand of God;” </em>Hebrews 10:12.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section13" dir="LTR">
<p>This last verse has a new word following “eis”; it is from the Greek word “dienekes” (pronounced dee-ay-nek-es’), meaning: “carried through, perpetually, continually, for ever.”</p>
<p><strong>This combination gives us the meaning that we have always understood for the expression “for ever”!</strong> The next texts also comes from “eis dienekes.”</p>
<p>“<em>From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. For by one offering he hath perfected <strong>for ever</strong> them that are sanctified.”</em> Hebrews 10:13-14.</p>
<p>“<em>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and <strong>for ever</strong></em> [eis aion].” Hebrews 13:8.</p>

<h3><a name="fstudy">Planning Your Further Study</a></h3>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Given the number of options, is it possible to arrive at the correct meaning of a passage having the words “forever” or “for ever” in it? Obviously, some passages indicate eternity while others must have “a point in time” in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: Yes!</strong> In many, if not all cases, you can, but it will require that you approach the effort:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Carefully</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li>
		<p>Prayerfully, requesting the help of the Holy Spirit</p>

	<li>
		<p>Considering the context of each passage</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
	<li>
		<p>With a great desire to understand. The following considerations are necessary:</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>What is the goal of our study? We are looking for Bible evidence to learn the truth about the subject of “Burning Hell.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Are the answers we arrive at consistent with the entire Bible and is it our desire to harmonize our thoughts with the whole Bible, rather than to just shore up long held beliefs?</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li>

<p>Here are a couple of examples from the above mentioned chart. Let me emphasize that <strong>these only apply when studying prophecy</strong>, and not every time you find one of the words in the Scriptures!</p>

<h3><a name="hf">Hell-Fire and its Results</a></h3>
<p>Now, let’s begin to add all these things together in order to develop in our minds what God is telling us about a supposedly ever-burning hell!</p>
<p>Here, in what is arguably the most famous Bible text there is, we find an <strong>amazing clue</strong>!</p>
<p>“<em>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</em>	John 3:16.</p>
<p>Let’s break this text down to grasp the important details. What is it that God did and what was the motivation? “<em>For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son…</em>”</p>
<p>And what was the purpose of this great gift? So that “<em>whosoever believeth in him should not perish!</em>” Should not	what? <strong>Perish</strong>! Does “perish” mean to continue to live? According to Strong’s Concordance, the Greek word from which we get “perish” is apollumi (pronounced ap-ol’-loo-mee).</p>
</div>

<div id="Section15" dir="LTR">
<p>The word means “to destroy fully.”</p>
<p>If anyone is to “burn forever,” in order for that to happen and for it to be any kind of punishment, he or she would have to continue living throughout the period of time that the fire was burning, correct? If so, and if the theory of an “ever-burning Hell” is also correct, that would mean that <strong>those burning forever would need to have immortality, the ability to not die!</strong></p>
<p>What does the Bible say about immortality?</p>
<p>“<em>Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; <strong>Who only hath immortality</strong>, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.”</em> 1 Timothy 6:15,16.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered immortality is <em>athanasia</em> (ath-an-as-ee’-ah). It means deathlessness, which is <strong>the inability to die</strong>!</p>
<p>	Returning to John 3, the very next verse says:</p>
<p>“<em>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through Him might be saved.”</em> John 3:17.</p>
<p><strong>How marvelous the love of God is!</strong></p>
<p>Please note that without the sacrifice of Christ we are all condemned, because we are all sinners!</p>
<p>“<em>For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”</em> Romans 6:23.</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>we have earned death</strong>!</p>
<p>And without this fabulous, FREE offering of His precious life, as payment for our sins, we would ALL PERISH! (Or maybe, we would have never come into existence!) We must have faith in that offering!</p>
</div>
	
<div id="Section16" dir="LTR">
<p>Now, here is the passage that is most often used to buttress the idea of an unquenchable, or ever-burning fire. By the way, “unquenchable” means that it cannot be put out; it must go out by itself! Many firemen have battled with unquenchable fires. When a home burns to the ground, it is because the fire was unquenchable and did not go out until the fuel was consumed.</p>

<h3><a name="rev">REVELATION 14:9-11</a></h3>
<p>“<em>And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man
		worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead,
		or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God,
		which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; <strong>and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone	in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name</strong>.”</em> Revelation 14:9-11.</p>
<p>Consider this!</p>
<p>“<em>...and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:” Rev 14:10.</em></p>
<p>If we are to believe that this is literal, then we must believe that all the Holy angels are trapped or imprisoned, bound there for all eternity, detained in order to be in the presence of that eternal burning, if it were, in fact, to be eternal burning! God may be omnipresent, but not the angels.</p>
<p>Here’s an exercise for the reader: Take a wooden kitchen match and light it! Hold it with the head at a slightly higher level and when the head has stopped burning, wet your thumb and forefinger of your other hand. Now hold the match by the head, and allow the rest of the match to burn.</p>
</div>
	
<div id="Section17" dir="LTR">
<p>Did you quench it or did it go out by itself because there wasn’t any more material capable of sustaining the fire? This test illustrates the meaning of the phrase “everlasting fire”! It lasts until there is nothing left that is burnable!</p>
<p>QUESTION: What is the context of the above passage?</p>
<p>ANSWER: John is in vision, and describing <strong>what he sees in vision</strong>. We don’t know how long the vision lasted, but it was of course, a limited period of time! The vision and language obviously symbolize a future event! It was condensed! Does John continue to see it for countless eons to come? Is he still watching today? Did he envision that the fire would always burn? Or, is this a misunderstanding on our part because of the wording? Let’s ask ourselves a few questions relating to this passage.</p>
<p>First, what does drinking of the “wine of the wrath of God” mean? It means <strong>God is recompensing those who have hurt</strong></p>
<p><strong>His children and desecrated His universe! The wicked are partaking of God’s wrath.</strong></p>
<p>Secondly, what does “without mixture” mean? It means that <strong>the wine of wrath is undiluted!</strong> Up until now God’s judgments have been mixed with mercy, <strong>but now mercy has ceased.</strong></p>
<p>Thirdly, does their “torment” (burning) last forever? <strong>If this was so, that would mean that these people would have immortality, the inability to die, which would contradict what we found in 1 Timothy 6:15, 16!</strong> It is the smoke from the fire that is described as rising up “for ever and ever”! Most everyone has stood next to a campfire that was slowly burning out. The smoke rising up into the air, ever onward and upward, appears to rise forever until out of sight. Eventually, however, no more smoke will rise from the ashes. Why? Because the fuel is consumed.</p>
<p>Fourthly, would a <em>continual burning</em> (such as seems to be described) be fair? We know that God is fair, so would this be in harmony with His character of eternal love?</p>
</div>

<div id="Section18" dir="LTR">
<p>“Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” Genesis 12:8. Note what God said to the prophet Ezekiel:</p>
<p>“<em>Say unto them,</em>[the Children of Israel, and us]<em> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, <strong>I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked</strong>; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?”</em> Ezekiel 33:11.</p>
<p>Can we hear and weep with Him, thinking of the pathos in His plea? God has described His own mindset in the Bible in many places.</p>
<p>“<em>For I am the LORD, <strong>I change not</strong>; therefore ye sons of Jacob <strong>are not consumed</strong>.” Malachi 3:6.</em></p>
<p><strong>Would it be equitable</strong> for a person who was born a few years before the end of the world, having rejected God’s calling, to suffer the punishment as long as do Adolph Hitler, Cain or Satan? Even worse, should one who has rejected God, but otherwise was a relatively decent person, who lived 5,000 years ago, have to suffer 5,000 years longer than Hitler or Stalin? How do <strong>you</strong> answer these questions?</p>
<p>Fifthly, imagine you were in Heaven. Would you like to be able to check in on Uncle George, Mom, Dad, or your children occasionally, <strong>throughout all eternity</strong>, to see how much of them has burned, or to just listen to their screams? <strong>If you could do that, would it be heaven for you? Do you think our loving God would care to do that?</strong> If this were the case, the Omniscient God Himself would have to see all His children that He loves passionately, suffering…<em><strong>for eternity</em>! Can you imagine that?</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, does the idea of “ever-burning hell” agree with the rest of the Scriptures? Well, let’s do some investigation and see what we find.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section19" dir="LTR">
<h3><a name="text">Texts About the End of Hell-Fire</a></h3>
<p>“<em>For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, <strong>shall be stubble</strong>: and the day that cometh shall <strong>burn them up</strong>, saith the LORD of hosts, that <strong>it shall leave them neitherroot nor branch.</strong> ... And ye shall tread down the wicked; for <strong>they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet</strong> in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.”</em> Malachi 4:1, 3.</p>
<p>“<em>Behold, <strong>they shall be as stubble</strong>; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: <strong>there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.</strong>”</em> Isaiah 47:14.</p>
<p>“<em>And then shall that </em>[those lawless ones: see note below]<em> Wicked <strong>be revealed</strong>, whom the Lord <strong>shall consume</strong> with the spirit of his mouth, and <strong>shall destroy with the brightness of his coming</strong>: Even him, whose coming <strong>is after the working of Satan</strong> with all power and signs and lying wonders, And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness <strong>in them that perish</strong>; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.”</em> 2 Thessalonians 2:8-10.</p>
<p>NOTE: The three word phrase, “shall that Wicked” in the text above, comes from one Greek word, <em>anomos</em> (an’-om-os), which means: those lawless ones – those who have decided that they were not going to obey God’s law! <strong>At the head of this</strong>	<strong>pack is the beast power</strong>, the “man of sin” introduced in verse 3.</p>
<p>The capitalization of the word “wicked” (KJV) is unfortunate. No doubt it was capitalized because some have believed it refers to Satan! (Also the word “that” should have been “those”, making it read, “shall those wicked ones”!) The belief that Satan is the one mentioned in the original language is wrong, because in verse 9 we see that “the lawless” have been induced and molded into their behavior by Satan! Furthermore, <strong>as we shall see, Satan will be destroyed after the thousand years, not at Christ’s second coming!</strong></p>
</div>

<div id="Section20" dir="LTR">
<h3><a name="ete1">End Time Events (Part One)</a></h3>
<p>Here’s what the Bible says happens at the <strong>coming first resurrection</strong>:</p>
<p>“<em>For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and <strong>the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</strong>”</em> 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17.</p>
<p>Note that the phrase, “shall we ever” in verse 17 is from the Greek word	<em>pantote</em> (pan’-tot-eh), meaning, <strong>“at all times.”</strong> This is made possible because they <strong>“put on immortality” at the resurrection </strong>(1 Corinthians 15:52-54).</p>
<p>By the way, the “shout” and the “voice” of the archangel disprove the “<strong>secret rapture</strong>” theory! Also, regarding this so-called “secret rapture,” how does it line up with Revelation 1:7, which says,<em> “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and <strong>every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him</strong>…”</em>?</p>
<p>What, in addition to faith in Jesus, qualifies God’s people to be raised in this first resurrection? There is no such thing as “faith alone.” To say that I believe, and to take no action on God’s word, indicates that I don’t believe! According to James, “Faith without works is dead” (James 2:20). <strong>So, faith, for it to be real faith, requires us to take action!</strong> What kind of action in particular? The following texts will help answer this question.</p>
<p>“<em>And the dragon was wroth </em>[orgizo, pronounced or-gid’-zo, meaning enraged] <em>with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, <strong>which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”</strong></em> Revelation 12:17.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section21" dir="LTR">
<p>NOTE: The scriptures symbolize a church as a woman! Either a good or evil church, depending on their deeds! (See the Prophetic Symbols Chart, pg. 41.)</p>
<p>“<em>Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that <strong>keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus</strong>.”</em> Revelation 14:12.</p>
<p>Think about this: Verse 12 includes the “faith OF Jesus,” and OF God; Without the faithfulness OF the Godhead, our faith IN them would be misplaced! Furthermore, it is not a mere faith IN Jesus, <strong>but the same faith Jesus possessed.</strong> This is what is comprehended in Colossians 1:27, “…Christ in you, the hope of glory.”</p>
<p>“<em>Blessed are they that <strong>do his commandments</strong>, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. For without</em> [outside the Holy City] <em>are dogs</em> [human ones]<em>, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.”</em> Revelation 22:14-15.</p>
<p>What did these verses all have in common? The answer is commandment keeping. <strong>True faith will be followed by obedience to all God’s commandments!</strong></p>

<h3><a name="ete2">End Time Events - (Part Two)</a></h3>
<p>“<em>But the rest of the dead [the wicked] lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and Holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they [the righteous] shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.”</em> Rev. 20:5-6.</p>
<p>Note that this makes the theory of a second chance impossible, since the wicked are not alive to choose differently during the 1,000 years than they did before their death. Further, <strong>if the second chance theory WERE true</strong>, <strong>it could only apply to those who are alive at the time of Jesus’ second coming!</strong></p>
</div>
	
<div id="Section22" dir="LTR">
<p>Those already gone cannot make any more decisions. <strong>But how would that be fair to those who have already passed away over the centuries, and who consequently would not have the second chance option?</strong></p>
<p>What happens to Satan at that time?</p>
<p>“<em>And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and <strong>bound him a thousand years</strong>.”</em> Revelation 20:1-2.</p>
<p>This 1,000 years parallels the time that the righteous spend with Jesus, in heaven (Revelation 20:5, 6). The expression “Bottomless pit” comes from the Greek word <em>abussos</em> (ab’-us-os), meaning abyss!	<strong>Is this a literal bottomless pit? NO!</strong> (Remember that this is part of a prophecy). Satan is “bound” to the earth by the circumstances. There is nobody on the earth who is alive for him to tempt. I imagine that his angels are <strong>very unhappy </strong>with him, as they now realize their fate. So if they are communicating with him at all, whatever the conversations consist of, they can’t be pleasant!</p>
<p>Since Satan is a student of God’s word, he is aware of his future as indicated in the Bible. He knows he has “a certain <strong>fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries</strong>” (Hebrews 10:27)!</p>
<p>“<em>Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.”</em> James 2:19.</p>
<p>Imagine the misery that Satan and all his evil ones will experience over that 1,000 year time period as they consider their rebellious, wasted lives and upcoming destruction!</p>

<h3><a name="hnow">Anyone in Hell Now?</a></h3>
<p>	Are there any persons suffering in hell now? NO, not according to God’s word!</p>
</div>

<div id="Section23" dir="LTR">
<p>“<em>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and <strong>to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished.</strong>”</em> 2 Peter 2:9.</p>
<p>Note that the last phrase in the verse is “to be punished.” This is a future event, not a current punishing! We find the same witness in the Old Testament:</p>
<p>“<em>That the wicked is</em> [are] <em><strong>reserved to the day of destruction</strong>? <strong>They shall be brought forth to the day of wrath</strong>.”</em> Job 21:30.</p>

<h3><a name="1000">After the 1,000 Years?</a></h3>
<p>“<em><strong>And when the thousand years are expired</strong>, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.”</em> Revelation 20:7-9.</p>
<p>Who are Gog and Magog? According to the Concordance, Gog is a symbolic name for some future Anti-Christ (singular), and Magog is an Anti-Christian group (plural). Keep in mind that those names had to be recognized in John the Revelator’s time and forward. We can recognize them now by their description. Prior to the second coming of Christ, there will be a great battle fought that is similar in nature to the battle after the millennium. That will be the Battle of Armageddon.</p>

<h3><a name="arm">Armageddon Prophecy</a></h3>
<p>The principles in this struggle are GOD and JESUS in HEAVEN and Lucifer on earth. Man is being used by Satan as pawns—<strong>pawns gathered together to make war against Christ and His commandment-keeping followers.</strong></p>
</div>

<div id="Section24" dir="LTR">
<p>The location is Armageddon. The description of this place is said to be a physical hill called Megiddo, an archaeological site on the plain of Esdraelon, south of present-day Haifa in Israel. This is supposedly the place where the last battle between good and evil will be fought, where a dramatic and catastrophic conflict will likely destroy the world or the human race.</p>
<p><strong>To show that this literal location is inadequate to fulfill the prophetic description, consider the following</strong>:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>The area is entirely too small an area to hold all the forces of Satan—all the kings of the world and their armies, consisting of all God’s enemies that ever lived!</p></li>
	<li><p>The battle of evil begun in Eden and resumed after the flood, has mushroomed exponentially over the centuries and embraces the entire world!</p></li>
	<li><p>The Bible shows us that evil reaches a peak in the last days on a world-wide scale.</p></li>
	<li><p>The 16th Chapter of Revelation starts out with <strong>seven “last plagues” that affect the whole earth</strong>! Armageddon happens between the sixth and seventh plagues!</p></li>
	<li><p>Right after that, we see that the seventh plague happens, which <strong>signals the end of the worldwide conflict.</strong></p>	</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice the players in this portrayal, and what they do!</p>
<p>“<em>For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. <strong>Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</strong> And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.”</em> Revelation 16:14-16.</p>
<p>“<em>And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.”</em> Revelation 16:17.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section25" dir="LTR">
<p>Read Revelation 16:18-21 to see what happens during the seventh plague.</p>
<p>NOTE: Verse 21 speaks about “great hail out of heaven”!</p>
<p>Clear back in the book of Job, God asks Job:</p>
<p>“<em>Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?”</em> Job 38:22, 23.</p>
<p><strong>It is at the close of the seventh plague that Jesus comes and the wicked are slain by the brightness of His coming. At this time, the righteous dead come forth at “the resurrection of life” (John 5:29), also called “the first resurrection.”</strong></p>
<p>“<em>Blessed and holy is he that hath part in <strong>the first resurrection</strong>: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.”</em> Revelation 20:6.</p>
<p>Then after the 1,000 years are over and the New Jerusalem comes down out of heaven to the earth, the wicked are raised at “<strong>the resurrection of damnation</strong>” (John 5:29).	<strong>Once they re-group, the battle resumes.</strong></p>
<p>“<em>But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.”</em> Revelation 20:5a.</p>
<p>Once the wicked are raised, Satan is loosed, because he once again has subjects to tempt. Notice what he does.</p>
<p>“<em>And <strong>when the thousand years are expired</strong>, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison </em>[pit]<em>, And <strong>shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth </strong>, <strong> Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle</strong>: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. <strong>And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.”</strong></em> Revelation 20:7-9.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section26" dir="LTR">
<p>“<em>And <strong>death and hell were cast into the lake of fire</strong>. This is the second death. <strong>And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.</strong>”</em> Revelation 20:14-15.</p>
<p>	NOTE: If there wasn’t a first death (and we know that there was according to verse 5), then there would not be a second death.</p>
<p>So, we see clearly that the wicked gather together under the leadership of Satan who first organizes, and then leads them into battle against the Holy City! This is similar to the Battle of Armageddon, only this time Satan’s militia is comprised of the wicked of all ages, not just one generation. <strong>What an immense army! </strong>Let’s read againwhat happens to that vast, wicked host:</p>
<p>“<em>And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and <strong>fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them</strong>.”</em> Revelation 20:9.</p>

<h3><a name="fire">AFTER THE GREAT FIRE!</a></h3>
<p>“<em>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the <strong>heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</strong>”</em> 2 Peter 3:10.</p>
<p>The heavens (Greek: <em>ouranos</em>; pronounced oo-ran-os’, meaning: the sky, and by implication, happiness), are the old, polluted, (physical, mental and ideological) atmosphere!</p>
<p>Note that the “<strong>great noise</strong>” and	<strong>suddenness of the event</strong>, in addition to the Bible resolution described by “<strong>burned up</strong>,” do not fit with the idea of a continual burning!</p>
</div>

<div id="Section27" dir="LTR">
<h3><a name="nhe">A NEW HEAVEN AND EARTH</a></h3>
<p>“<em>And I saw <strong>a new heaven and a new earth</strong>: <strong>for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away</strong>; and there was no more sea.”</em> Revelation 21:1.</p>
<p>This is the same New Heavens and New Earth that God showed Isaiah in vision!</p>
<p>“<em>For as <strong>the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, </strong>shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.”</em> Isaiah 66:22-24.</p>
<p>Hear the words of Jesus:</p>
<p>“<em>And he that sat upon the throne said,  <strong>Behold, I make all things new.</strong> And he said unto me, <strong>Write: for these words are true and faithful.</strong>”</em> Revelation 21:5.</p>
<p>This reveals to us Who was speaking through Isaiah the prophet. It was none other than our Savior!</p>
<p>“<em><strong>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth</strong>: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.”</em> Isaiah 65:17.</p>
<p>“<em>Nevertheless we, <strong>according to his promise, look</strong> for <strong>new heavens and a new earth</strong>, <strong>wherein dwelleth righteousness!</strong>”</em> 2 Peter 3:13.</p>
<p>	These Heavens restore the happiness that was virtually destroyed by sin!</p>

<h3><a name="res">THE FIRST RESURRECTION EVENTS</a></h3>
<p>“<em>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and <strong>so shall we ever be with the Lord</strong>. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.”</em> 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section28" dir="LTR">
<p>The word “ever” in the passage above, is yet another Greek word—	<em>pantote</em> (pan’-tot-eh), which means, “at all times”!</p>

<h3><a name="imm">IMMORTALITY?</a></h3>
<p>“<em>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,<strong> at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</strong>”</em> 1 Corinthians 15:50-53.</p>
<p>"<em>And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.”</em> Revelation 20:4.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: Who are the ones involved in this judgment, and what are they doing during that 1,000 years?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER</strong>: They are the righteous ones, who, during the 1,000 years, are reviewing the sentences of the wicked! They are finding out why Uncle George and Aunt Minerva are not in Heaven! Or, why someone they thought wouldn’t be there, is!</p>
<p>“<em><strong>Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?</strong> and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?”</em> 1 Corinthians 6:2, 3.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section29" dir="LTR">
<h3><a name="hell">WHO IS GOING TO BE IN HELL?</a></h3>
<p>“<em>But the <strong>fearful</strong>, and <strong>unbelieving</strong>, and the <strong>abominable</strong>, and <strong>murderers</strong>, and <strong>whoremongers</strong>, and <strong>sorcerers</strong>, and <strong>idolaters</strong>, and <strong>all liars</strong>, shall have their part in <strong>the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone</strong>: <strong>which is the second death</strong>.”</em> Revelation 21:8.</p>
<p>LOOK AT THIS ALERT:</p>
<p>“<em>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; <strong>He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</strong>”</em> Revelation 2:11.</p>
<p>John, the Revelator was in vision when he saw this! Let’s read it again, starting with verse 8:</p>
<p>“<em>And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: <strong>And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</strong>”</em> Revelation 14:8-11.</p>
<p>Since this <strong>may seem to be incompatible</strong> with the rest of the Bible, there has to be something that we don’t see at the first reading! So, let’s see what we can find in Strong’s concordance as we look for the meanings of these verses.</p>
<p>In verse 8, we see that an entity called “Babylon” has fallen!</p>
</div>

<div id="Section30" dir="LTR">
<h3><a name="bab">WHO OR WHAT IS BABYLON?</a></h3>
<p>According to Strong’s Concordance, the name can be either literal or figurative! In this case, it started out as a literal city called Babel, built by Nimrod. It was where an infamous tower would be built! Because of the resulting confusion from God’s confounding of the languages, the name Babel came to be recognized as “babble”! This is a fit portrayal of the confusing babble that is spoken by this wicked power!</p>
<p>Here is the beginning of the city, from the Bible!</p>
<p>“<em>He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. And the beginning of his kingdom was <strong>Babel</strong>, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh,</em> [all cities] <em>in the land of Shinar.”</em> Genesis 10:9-10.</p>
<p>Now the story resulting in their downfall:</p>
<p>“<em>And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</em></p>
<p><em>And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.</em></p>
<p><em>So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.”</em> Genesis 11:3-9.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section31" dir="LTR">
<p>Understand that the reason they wanted to do this was because of their <strong>disbelief in God’s promise</strong> (see below). They wanted to build this tower to be higher than water could reach, should there be another flood, and thereby they would be protected in case such a deluge happened!</p>
<p>	Here’s God’s promise to Noah for the future:</p>
<p>“<em>I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: <strong>And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.</strong>”</em> Genesis 9:13-15.</p>
<p>From that time forward, the name Babylon has stood for “Confusion,” because that was where God confused their languages.</p>

<h3><a name="pbab">PROPHETIC BABYLON</a></h3>
<p>“<em>And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.”</em> Revelation 14:8.</p>
<p>So when the angel announces that “Babylon is fallen,” that signals the soon-coming end of confusion caused by false religion. The error of these post-flood people was then, and still is for many people today, that they can save themselves!</p>
<p>Let’s examine just a few points concerning this modern Babylon:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Babylon is described as a great city. The word “great” comes from the Greek word <em>megas</em> (pronounced meg’-as). This is where we get the word “mega”! Often you will hear of mega churches, <strong>but none are so mega as this one!</strong> As we have already mentioned, a woman in Bible prophecy represents a church.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="Section32" dir="LTR">
<p>So, why has she fallen, and how did she become so mega? The answers are found within the verse: “<strong>because she made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication</strong>.”</p>
<ol start="2">
	<li>
		<p>The words “<strong>she made all nations drink</strong>” are derived from two Greek words, <em>potizo</em> (pot-id’-zo), meaning: furnish, irrigate or imbibe; and <em>ethnos</em> (eth-nos’),meaning: foreigner, people, or nations. In other words,<strong>this city became great by getting all nations drunk!</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>With what? Wine! <strong>What is this wine?</strong> The Greek word is<em>oinos </em>(oy’-nos), meaning: “wine, <strong>either literally or figuratively</strong>,” and in this case the imbibing is figurative, of course!</p>
<ol start="3">
	<li>
		<p>	The Greek word for “wrath” is <em>thumos</em> (thoo-mos’). Strong’s reveals that it means harlotry and passion, as if breathing hard! The Greek for “fornication” is <em>porneia</em> (por-ni’-ah), meaning: harlotry (including adultery and incest).</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li>
		<p><strong>This harlotry is religious in nature</strong>. It indicates that those involved have gone “whoring after other gods,” and doing so passionately!</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li>
		<p>She not only accomplishes her purpose through teaching, but through <strong>legislation</strong>. Her fornication is with “the kings of the earth” and through them she is able to coerce the earth’s inhabitants.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>“<em>With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.”</em> Revelation 17:2.</p>
<p>To summarize: This great and powerful entity is extremely passionate about the spread of the worship of some thing or person, <strong>other than God!</strong> Furthermore it <strong>was, and still is</strong>, able to instill, or you could say, impregnate, a great many of those who were not already constituents with her doctrine, which is <strong>worship centered on Babylon herself, not on the one and only Supreme God!</strong></p>
</div>

<div id="Section33" dir="LTR">
<p>By the way, this worship also violates both the first and second of the Ten Commandments! The first commandment reads:</p>
<p>“<em>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.”</em> Exodus 20:3.</p>
<p>And here’s the Second Commandment:</p>
<p>“<em>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them:</strong> for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; And shewing mercy unto thousands of them <strong>that love me, and keep my commandments.</strong>”</em> Exodus 20:4-6.</p>
<p>The identification of who constitutes the “beast and his image” and the “666” number of her name, etc., will be left for another, wider study of the prophecy. However, the Bible itself does clearly identify this entity!</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What would be the reason for divulging the identity of these entities?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Contrary to the claim today, that it would constitute a “Hate Crime,” <strong>the truth is that the desire to expose them is motivated by love</strong>. It is a warning from the same mindset that provides us with “Railroad Crossing” lights “Bridge Out” signs and so forth. It is to try to protect others from (in this case) eternal loss.</p>
<p>Returning to the study of Revelation 14, in verse 9, a “third angel” tells us that anyone who worships this beast or his image will be identified, by a mark, <strong>as her follower</strong>.</p>
<p>“<em>And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and <strong>receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand</strong>…”</em></p>
</div>

<div id="Section34" dir="LTR">
<p>The word “mark” is from the Greek word <em>charagma</em> (khar’-ag-mah), meaning: “a mark of servitude.” This mark of servitude is received	<strong>in the forehead</strong> (symbolic of the thoughts, and the decisions of the mind), or <strong>in his hand</strong> (Greek-	<em>cheir</em>, pronounced khire), meaning hand in a literal or figurative way. Symbolically, this would refer to action, as in deeds or works.</p>
<p>Revelation 14:10 continues by declaring that members of this Babylonian group will “drink of the <strong>wine</strong> of the wrath of God.” As we noted above, the Greek words <em>potizo</em> and <em>ethnos</em> (“made all nations drink”) mean literally, “to irrigate foreigners”! Babylon made the nations drink. God, on the other hand, does not make them drink, but warns them that this will be their fate if they continue under Babylon’s intoxication. The following notes will break this down.</p>
<p><strong>Note 1</strong>. “The wrath” (<em>thumos</em>, meaning passion) “of God” (<em>theos</em>, pronounced theh’os).</p>
<p><strong>Note 2. Babylon “makes”, “coerces”, or “tricks”</strong>, this group to drink! <strong>God’s wine</strong> in contrast, <strong>is offered and accepted without any chicanery!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note 3</strong>. The “cup” (<em>poterion</em>, pronounced pot-ay’-ree-on) figuratively means fate or lot.</p>
<p><strong>Note 4</strong>. “indignation,” (<em>orge</em>, pronounced or- gay’) means justifiable abhorrence.</p>
<p><strong>Note 5</strong>. “shall be tormented” (<em>basanizo</em>, bas-an-id’-zo) means tortured or in pain.</p>
<p><strong>Note 6</strong>. “with fire and brimstone”—The Greek for fire is <em>pur</em> (poor), figuratively meaning lightning; brimstone in Greek	is <em>theion</em> (thion) meaning sulphur.</p>
<p><strong>Note 7</strong>. “in the presence of the holy angels and the Lamb”.</p>
<p>This last phrase explains itself.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section35" dir="LTR">
<p>Bringing verses 9 &amp;10 together in a paraphrase, using today’s English, it would read something like this:</p>
<p>“<em>The lot or fate of these deluded drunkards is to receive the results of their worship of this false god, behavior which is abhorrent to the true God! The punishment will be death by lightning (which can last for a while) accompanied by the terrible smell of sulphur! This will happen in the presence of the Holy Angels and the Lamb!”</em></p>
<p><strong>Nothing in this verse indicates a prolonged period of suffering!</strong> In fact, generally, lightning is sudden and over quickly, and is sometimes accompanied by a sulphur smell. With that in mind, let’s take another look at verse 11.</p>
<p>“<em>And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Note 8</strong>. “ascendeth up” in Greek is <em>anabaino</em> (an-ab-ah’-ee-no) meaning to go up, either literally or figuratively! The first “for ever” in Greek is <em>eis</em> (ice), meaning (as we discussed earlier) <strong>a point reached to</strong>, or into; the second “ever” in the Greek is <em>aion</em> (ahee-ohn’), meaning <strong>an age.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note 9.</strong> This first part of the verse says that <strong> the smoke reached to or into a certain point!</strong> In other words, it doesn’t continue rising; it has a destination!<strong> An age is an element of time (not a place) unlike eternity, which is timeless!</strong></p>
<p>So, since the earth will be destroyed, nothing is left that produces smoke!</p>
<p>Since an age is <strong>a determinate amount of time</strong>, how can we believe that the fire or smoke lasts longer than God’s word indicates? We have seen that the Bible indicates that the fire doesn’t continue!</p>
<p><strong>Note 10</strong>. “They have no rest day or night” Revelation 14:11.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section36" dir="LTR">
<p>The Greek for rest is <em>anapausis</em> (an-ap’-ow-sis), <strong>meaning intermission</strong>. So they have no intermission! This is not restricted to the time when they are burning up, but to their condition as long as they worship the beast. <strong>Note that the verse does not point back to when they worshipped (past tense), but to those who worship (present tense). So long as they are drunken with the wine of Babylon, they have no rest, no peace.</strong></p>
<p>“<em>There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.” </em>Isaiah 48:22.</p>
<p>“<em>For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.”</em> Jeremiah 8:11.</p>
<p>“<em>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?”</em> Hebrews 3:18.</p>
<p>Conversely, those who follow the Lamb and keep His commandments do find rest.</p>
<p>“<em>Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.”</em> Psalm 119:165.</p>
<p>“<em>He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.”</em> Isaiah 57:2.</p>
<p>“<em>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.”</em> Matthew 11:28, 29.</p>
<p><strong>Note 11</strong>. Those who have worshipped the beast and his image will suffer with no intermission until they have lost consciousness. After that, of course,<strong> they need no rest, because they are no longer alive!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note 12</strong>. Since God says in Revelation 22:12 that the reward He is bringing with Him will be given to every man “according as his works shall be,” couldn’t we therefore conclude that no matter how hot or long the fire burns, God will shorten the <strong>time of suffering</strong> for each individual, to match the reward <strong>he has earned?</strong></p>
</div>

<div id="Section37" dir="LTR">
<p><strong>Satan, of course, will burn the longest amount of time, because he has earned it!</strong> (Romans 6:23.) Nothing in the Scriptures says that even Satan will continually exist in flames! Here is a prophecy concerning Satan:</p>
<p>“<em>All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, <strong>and never shalt thou be any more.”</strong> Ezekiel 28:19</em></p>

<h3><a name="conc">CONCLUSIONS</a></h3>
<p>God’s word is true, and we can be confident that whether He spoke it directly or through His spokesmen by the Holy Ghost (2nd Peter 1:21), He would never provide conflicting information within the Bible! That would confuse us! (Satan is the one who has dedicated his entire existence to confusing us.) God’s great love would never permit Him to do that. So, if what we read seems to be confusing, we know that it is our understanding that is deficient and we need to continue our study, praying for the Holy Spirit’s enlightenment, until the subject becomes absolutely clear to us, and is <strong>in harmony with all the rest of His word!</strong></p>
<p>SPECIAL NOTE: God tells us to study, and He tells us how to do so!</p>
<p>“<em>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.”</em> John 5:39.</p>
<p><strong>These are Jesus’ own words!</strong></p>
<p>Stop and consider this important question: <strong>What were the Scriptures Jesus referred to?</strong> The answer is the Old Testament! <strong>There was no New Testament in Jesus’ time!</strong> However, the N.T. is here now and it harmonizes with the O.T.!</p>
<p>“<em>For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:”</em> Isaiah 28:10.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section38" dir="LTR">
<p>Precepts are ideas! This verse talks about building your beliefs from scripture! I pray that we all, <em>“Prove all things, hold fast that which is good”</em>! 1 Thessalonians 5:21.</p>
<h3>A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:</h3>
<p>GOD COULD HAVE ERADICATED THE EARTH AND ALL THAT WAS IN IT! HE COULD HAVE THEN REMOVED THE MEMORY OF THE WORLD AND HIS DESTRUCTION OF IT FROM THE UNIVERSE(S?), WHO HAVE MEMORY CAPACITY! WHY DIDN’T HE DO THAT AND START OVER? THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE HIS CHARACTER WOULDN’T ALLOW HIM TO DO IT! EVEN THOUGH NO ONE ELSE WOULD KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED—HE WOULD—AND THAT WOULD NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH HIS CHARACTER OF LOVE!</p>
<p>Again, the Father of Lies, SATAN, is the provider of confusion and death!</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge today is to develop a precious, ever-growing relationship with Jesus, while we are yet alive! We certainly don’t want to hear the following sentence from Him:</p>
<p>“<em><strong>And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.”</strong></em> Matthew 7:23.</p>
<p>The word “knew” denotes intimacy, not just a casual knowledge, like knowing your name and where you live, etc!</p>

<h3><a name="end">THE END OF EVIL!</a></h3>
<p>“<em>What do ye imagine against the LORD? He will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.”</em> Nahum 1:9.</p>
<p>“<em>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</em> John 3:16.</p>
<p>The Greek word in the New Testament for “everlasting” is <em>aionios</em> (ahee-o’-nee-os), meaning eternal or perpetual. It has to do with the effects of our decisions while on earth.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section39" dir="LTR">
<p><strong>The results of our decisions and actions are, in fact, either Eternal life or Eternal death!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Again, as stated earlier, after the fires have burned out, <em>the smoke will have ascended up! It is gone forever! The final wisp has been obliterated by God’s overwhelming LOVE! Now ETERNAL PEACE REIGNS!</strong></em></p>
<p>“<em>Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”</em> 2 Peter 3:13.</p>
<p>One inspired writer has eloquently put it this way:</p>
<p>“In the City of God ‘there shall be no night.’ None will need or desire repose. There will be no weariness in doing the will of God and offering praise to His name. We shall ever feel the freshness of the morning and shall ever be far from its close....</p>
<p>All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of God’s redeemed. Unfettered by mortality, they wing their tireless flight to worlds afar--worlds that thrilled with sorrow at the spectacle of human woe and rang with songs of gladness at the tidings of a ransomed soul....</p>
<p>The great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more. The entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats through the vast creation. From Him who created all, flow life and light and gladness, throughout the realms of illimitable space. From the minutest atom to the greatest world, all things, animate and inanimate, in their unshadowed beauty and perfect joy, declare that God is love.”</p>
