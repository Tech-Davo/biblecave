<h1>What Is Jesus Doing Now</h1>
	
<h4>GLOW - Giving Light to Our World</h4>

<p>Ever wonder what Jesus is doing right now? According to the Bible, after Jesus died for the sins of the world, He rose from the dead and ascended to heaven. So what is He doing right now? Is He just sitting on a cloud? Is <p>He passing His time watching what we are doing here on earth while seated on His throne? Is He supervising the construction of our golden-brick homes in heaven?</p>
Fortunately, we don’t have to speculate. The Bible tells us exactly what Jesus is doing right now. He is judging you and me in preparation for His soon return.</p>

<p>Impossible! you may be thinking.</p>

<p>It’s more than possible. The Bible says: “Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent, because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead” (Acts 17:30-31, emphasis added).</p>

<p>This inspired passage teaches that God Almighty “will judge the world by the Man whom He has ordained.” That “Man” is Jesus Himself, who “rose from the dead.” Jesus affirmed the same truth when He declared, “the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son” (John 5:22). That settles it. Jesus isn’t just our Savior who died for our sins, but He is our Judge also.</p>


<h3>Investigating What Jesus Is Doing</h3>

<p>But is He judging us today? Some believe so, others disagree. If you ask five pastors, four priests, and even the Pope, you may get ten different answers. But speculation is worthless, just like the flowery promises of many politicians. So let’s allow God to answer this question.</p>

<p>In the 14th chapter of His book of Revelation—the greatest book of apocalyptic prophecy ever written—verses 14-16 describe Jesus Christ’s visible and climactic return at the end of the world. Notice carefully the same chapter’s earnest proclamation about what occurs just prior to His return.</p>
Verse six depicts a holy angel shouting to “every nation, tribe, tongue, and people . . . , ‘Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour His judgment has come” (Revelation 14:7, emphasis added).</p>

<p>Look closely. Pick up a Bible and read for yourself. Revelation 14:7 boldly announces that “the hour of His judgment has come,” and this judgment takes place at exactly the same time that the “everlasting gospel”—the message of salvation through Christ’s death and resurrection—is being preached worldwide (verse 6). This announcement also occurs just prior to His glorious return to the earth (compare verses 6-7 with verses 14-16 and Matthew 24:14). Putting these pieces together shows that humans are being judged now, before Christ’s return. And as we have already learned from Acts 17:30-31 and John 5:22, Jesus Himself is our Judge.</p>

<p>Why is Jesus judging us? First, because when He returns to earth He will dispense rewards and punishments (see Revelation 22:12), and each person’s case must be decided before Christ’s return so He can “render to each one according to his deeds” (Romans 2:5-10). In multiple places the Bible reveals that before God punishes the wicked or rewards the righteous, an investigation takes place where the deeds and motives of those being judged are brought to light before the universe (see Daniel 7:9-10; Revelation 20:11-15;1 Corinthians 4:5). The universe!? Yes. The universe.</p>

<p>Why would God need to show other created beings the hearts of those He is judging? God wants everyone to see and trust His decision-making. David understood this clearly. When speaking to God he said, “that You may be found . . . blameless when You judge” (Psalm 51:4).</p>

<p>Such an open investigation of the hearts of the human family will prove God blameless when He executes justice on the sinner and gives eternal life to the saint.</p>
<p>When sin is finally destroyed forever, no one in God’s created universe will have any lingering doubts about God’s wisdom and goodness in dealing with sin, sinners, and the saved. Everyone in heaven will say, “Alleluia! Salvation and glory and honor and power belong to the Lord our God! For true and righteous are His judgments” (Revelation 19:1-2, emphasis added).</p>

<h3>A Warning and an Offer</h3>

<p>So what is the point for us today? As we saw earlier, just prior to Christ’s glorious return to earth, a proclamation will be given to the world warning all to “Fear God, and give glory to Him for the hour of His judgment has come” (Revelation 14:7). This message is now in your hands.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ is judging us now. When He returns, those persons who have responded to His gift of salvation, turned from sin, and trusted His grace, will be rescued and rewarded. Those who have rejected His merciful offer of salvation and held onto their evil ways will be punished. The judgment is unavoidable—it is coming to everyone. “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad” (2 Corinthians 5:10).</p>

<p>The book of Revelation says that “the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars” are destined for “the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death” (Revelation 21:8). Do any of these sins describe you? Make no mistake about it: Jesus Christ is the Judge, and every violation of the Ten Commandments is “written in the books” (Revelation 20:12).</p>

<p>The thought of being judged by a Being who knows our deepest secrets can be terrifying—and it ought to be. But God doesn’t want us to live in terror. He has provided a way for our darkest sins to be wiped clean from our record so that we can experience peace and freedom from guilt. “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).</p>

How can your record be cleansed? The Judge of all the earth has already started the process by paying the penalty for your sins. “For God so loved the world,” Jesus Himself stated, “that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16, emphasis added). If you repent, He will forgive and cleanse you of your guilt. If you trust Him fully, you too can be ready when He returns.</p>

<p>Today, you can choose to give yourself to God and then, by His grace, grow into a true follower of Christ as you gain strength through daily Bible study, prayer, and sharing of your faith.</p>

<p>Soon Jesus will come and “Not guilty!” will then be His verdict.</p>
